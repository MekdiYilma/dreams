After getting permission from my mother I remembered inviting fellow second grade student over for lunch. She was surprised I found out years later oh, that she was surprise a little, that the friend I had invited over was a black boy. She handled it with charm and dignity and he thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A year later he invited me to his home that had dirt floors and well worn furniture.

I am at a nature resort on top of a huge waterfall (think Niagara Falls, but closer together and multiple layers, and bit less touristy) . Parts of it are actually inside the waterfall. The resort has two main sections/buildings connected by a wide open-air walkway that crosses over the falls. You can look right over the edge, but there is a railing preventing people from falling. About 30 feet below part of the walkway is a natural pool that goes into a man made cave that's part of the resort. Lots of kids are playing there. There's glass from the edge of the pool that looks out over the falls - you can peek your head out and see straight down the whole falls - which is both scary and awesome. I go inside one of the buildings after admiring the brilliance and majesty of the scenery. One of the rooms connects to a cave that spirals up and creates a really cool echo effect. There are tiny pools of water surrounding the walkway through this area that are just roped off. A few attractive women come in to the room and start flirting with me and we have sex. Something sparks lucidity, but I don't really have control over my own actions, I am more or less just aware and in for the ride. Then I wake up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We follow the car as I wonder if we shouldn't have gone first with our four wheel drive. The road is narrow and hubby drives over some of the candles as they could not have been avoided. One of my boots slips off over the bumps and I'm afraid I'll get snow in it. I ask him if he brought his stuff but he didn't as he did not realize we would be staying.

I was lit from behind and I could see my shadow cast out onto the street and the people present who had turned toward me – a backlit figure in silhouette, emerging from the stairs. I ran on and have forgotten most of the details, but was confronted by a black woman with a baseball bat who was going to try to hit me. I woke. (The baseball bat had image had also appeared a couple of nights before, too).Later, at a restaurant, younger brother, D., as a child, was upset over losing a game to X.

49,,,,,Male,ID: hurd2015_post:vann details,05-26-2018,"3. I’ve decided to take a bus to the coast on my own. G was occupied and so I thought it would be nice to go by myself. I look at the beach and the ocean from my bus window and know I’ve made the right choice. When I get there, I feel hungry and go to an underground market where there are several food vendors. Most of it is pizza. I receive a phone call and answer it. It is a doctor, and he tells me that he has unfortunate news about my parents. I ask him to elaborate and he says that they had died in Kansas. I think that not only is there no reason for my parents to be in Kansas, but they wouldn’t even be there together. I tell him he must have the wrong number and hang up. I pace around the stalls, thinking about the conversation, and the vendors think I’m about to order food, which I don’t. My sister calls and I tell her about this strange conversation. I see on my phone that her number is in Kansas so I think that maybe the doctor was right after all and my parents really had died there. I am then outside, walking towards a small lonely building that looks a bit like a water tower. I go through the door and see great pools of dark water with shadows moving beneath the surface. Someone I know is in there, but they jump into the water and sink below, expecting me to get them. I am afraid because I know strange creatures are in there but muster up enough courage to dive in. It is dark as night in the water and I reach out for my friend, who in my mind looks like a green tentacle, and try not to be frightened by the giant sharks I see coming towards me. One of them gets close and I close my eyes and imagine that I’ve risen to the surface. I am then out of the water. I am then in a small market. I want to buy cereal but the only box has already been opened and has some toddler toys stuck in it. A girl is working there and I find out that her mother, which is my aunt, has died. I feel bad for her and vaguely remember something about my parents having a similar fate.

I have him in my arms now and am on a conference call with hubby and a man doing some business. I'm playing with my child and lightly bounce him or lift him and he laughs!! I'm amazed and say loudly that it's his first laugh. He is almost squealing with delight! I do this again and he is loving the action. Scene changes and I'm in a camp with hubby and his brother and his wife. Our kidlets are near as is another man. I throw the remnants of a joint into the fire, hoping no one smells the typical odour. The man says something like do you smoke DHA? I think he means either DMT or DHEA or another drug I've learned about from DD. I clarify and say it was DHE but mean DHEA. He then offers me a bizarre pipe that he stuffs with this hard oily matter akin to hash and lights it then hands it to me. It crumbles a bit and some hoes in my mouth. I start to gag and try not very successfully to remove it from my mouth. Hubby tries to help as we are suddenly in a sauna.

52,,,,,Male,ID: hurd2015_post:jazz details,05-26-2018,"3. I am in a very tall building in a Brooklyn-sequel neighborhood. I run into Ben Berry (an old band mate I haven't seen for years). I am surprised at first, but I'm so happy and excited to see him that I just give him a hug and don't think on it further. We decide to jam together. My horn is acting sounding strange, but I keep playing because I'm having fun. The fire alarm goes off and because we're on one of the top floors, we are advised to exit to the roof. This dream logic satisfied me so I went up with my saxophone. As we were climbing the stairs, Liam (a close friend) brought his drone and I started to see the dream through the lens of the drone. Once on the roof everything became a big party/festival. There were food trucks and bars and stages for bands - it was a lot of fun, but got sloppy quickly. Somehow in all the fun/madness I lost track of where Sarah (my fiancé) ended up. I didn't have a phone and so I just wandered. I ran into Ben again who said he was hungry. I said I would get food with him, so we took his motorcycle (I don't think he has one in waking life) to a burger joint after climbing down the fire escape. We then climbed back up once we had our burgers. Towards the end of the dream I had a very sudden sensation of fear. I heard screams from below and remembered that the building was on fire a while ago. Jumping to conclusions, I decided the screams were coming from people below us and I decided that the building was collapsing. (I say ""I decided"" because at this point it was somewhat clear to me that my thoughts were creating the dream reality - even though this wasn't the outcome I wanted, my dream logic dictated how the end of the dream should play out.) As the building was falling I began having simultaneous experiences of different people on the roof/ people in the building/people falling from the building/people in helicopters around the building - as well as alternate endings to the dream. I then woke up slightly confused and had thoughts of 9-11. I didn't had a connection to anyone in the attacks, nor have I thought much about 9-11 in the past several years, but it was a very emotional ending to the dream. And I'm not certain, but I think I was able to enter back into the dream and pick up where I was looking for Sarah and had an alternate ending where I found her and we partied and got rescued - but there was a James Bond element to it...That part is a bit fuzzy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is showing the suit to their friends. I think she is silly. Then I get to a pool and swim. The water temperature is perfect, I enjoy for a while. Then I´m in my room, lying in my bed with my partner Jaime. There´re a lot of people aron our bed, mostly students and clients. They are asking us the typical questions they ask in class. I begin to feel irritated. Suddenly, Jaime invites a woman to get into our bed. There´s nothing sexual involved in the invitation but I feel so angry that begin to shout them. Jaime laughs, he says she is his cousin from Paraguay (he has no such a cousin). I then decide to break our partnership. Clients and students ask me not to do that. They tell me two words, in french. I can´t remember them but I know they´re important. Then I am in another scene, talking to a doctor. I´m not in a session with him, only talking. He tells me ""you´re angry with your allergy, that´s why you never get over it"". I see a dead piece of meat. I know it´s from my belly. My daughters and I touch it with sticks.

She wasn’t there. I called out for her. She was upstairs. I went up and she was lying in bed in the redone bedroom. The ceiling had been covered with some patterned, clear flower decorations. It was a little overdone, but interesting. There was an opaque glass sliding door. I went over and opened it to see if there was a balcony. There really wasn’t. It was just a sloped roof with no rail. A child crawled out, but we/I pulled her back in because it wasn’t suitable for a child. Downstairs, tourists were coming by to see the work in progress Upstairs, in back, I crawled out, full of joy, and was sketching the burnt umber roof line above, trying to copy the shape, color, and pattern exactly. I tried to look at the side of the building, too. Up on the rooftop, I looked around to see the surrounding area. The owner wanted to tear down some shacks visible in the backyard. And looking down the left side, there was water – 3 bodies of water: a lake, a pond, and another body of water, in different sizes, and colors. Then they seemed to dry up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's right leg seems to drag a bit but it then curls up and I get its blanket and it seems content. Waves settled down. I go around to make sure everything is put away. B left a fish out and I go look at the camp. There's a large trough full of water and many fish in various states of health are swimming in it. Two are beside the trough almost dead as I consider tossing them in the trough. I then see a few that wide life have been eating and am shocked that B would have such little respect for the fish. I go back to the lake and ask kidlet if she has her rodent. She goes back up to the camp and I'm left with all her other stuff including toys that are loose and some are getting dumped. She has more than enough. I look up and the lake has changed with many more camps so I send hubby to help kidlet. I wake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a sensation of triumph for having overcome the paralysis with dignity. I look for a window, and fly through it. The feeling of euphoria is maintained. On the other side there is a large garden, as of the nineteenth century, with aviaries and black iron gazebos, gravel roads and huge trees. I begin to cross it when a male character on a tiny motorcycle passes close to me. In the back he carry a dog. I ask him to take me in a tour through the garden. The dog gets down the motorcycle and I get in. I look to the place where the motorcycle came and I see other dogs and rabbits. They are waving to me. I feel a joy fun but the main traits of the garden have disappeared. Now it has walls made of small orange stones orange (like polished pebbles). The character in the motorcycle takes me to the end of the garden. These walls seem an insurmountable limit but the bike climbs the wall at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to our previous position. When passing the other side we are on a terrace. Some people seem to party. It's night. They have drinks in their hands and look at the sky. The stars move. There are lights that rotate in the sky. It is an amazing spectacle. A person comes up behind me and says in my ear ""something very bad will happen to the moon."" I look at the moon ,. It is red. It scares me.

I'm floating on a street that looks familiar (I guess it's near my mother's house). It's night. Suddenly I realize that all my lucid dreams have night scenarios so I decide to try if I can change that at will (I have changed other aspects of a dream but not this). At first I find it hard, but I remember that I should relax and just imagine what I want. Finally I make it. Now it is day (although I do not see the sun). I fly up to the treetops, deciding what to do next. I can not decide it (this is very usual in my lucid dreams: too much to do, I don´t know what to do first and at the end I do very little). Finally I reach the Plaza de Mayo (a famous square at the capital city of my country, it is the place where the house of government is, and most public events are held). Apparently, it´s uninhabited. No cars, bus or people. I turned round a corner (always floating over) and I see a little man walking. It's like a person but smaller. It has a beard and the look of someone who is going to work but I am sure that he is not from world. I decide to go down and talk to him. I descend gently to the sidewalk. I see that he has something on his right shoulder. It is a little ghost , like Casper, some sort of blue flame with a face. I understand that this is his guardian spirit. I say to the man "" Hi! I'm on the other side!"" enthusiastically. He nods, with kind eyes and a fair condescending expression. I feel my energy is low so the lucidity will end soon. I say goodbye and promise him to return and have a talk about our worlds. The dream fades. I have not yet returned to that place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I find it difficult, the wall is much thicker than it looked like and I can´t get ""the other side"". Finally I land in a bathroom. The colors of the walls are very vivid and contrasting (orange, green). The walls have been painted recently. Everything is very bright. I have the feeling that someone else is there but I do not see him. I begin to feel a sense of closure so then decide to change the scenario. I sense there is a person on the other side of a door and then ask her to open that door for me. She does so, but doesn´t want to interact with me. She acts indifferently and leaves. I am now in a very long corridor with extremely vivid orange color. The walls are old bricks as if the area has been abandoned long ago. I floated across the corridor looking for a way out. I feel disgust of being so confined. I always prefer the open spaces in lucid dream trips so I can choose targets of exploration in space. The corridor seems endless but finally it appears a small opening to my left. It is a window. I'm not sure if I fit there. I have to enlarge the window or make myself smaller. I decide to melt my body so I could pass through the hole. I do it. I am free. The sky is very dark but the fresh air feels great. I say ""OK, now I can explore some distant planet"".

They want to record me on sax and bass, and even though I don't know what I'm doing they tell me I sound good. After a few takes I decide I need a break so I take a nap on the couch.

It is a giant mansion. I keep “waking” (FA) and talking to different people. At some point N___ is seated nearby and I ask, “What are you doing up?” I tell him to go back to bed. I wake up again (FA) and A___ is seated on the nearby couch just watching me sleep. I tell her to go to bed, it’s late. I meditate to consciously enter a lucid dream. I feel sound waves – emanations coming off / out of and into my head – I could see them from an OB perspective like heat emanating off a hot pavement. I think, “Why did I take that supplement, it’s too intense? I don’t feel good at all” (WR I felt like this from the galantamine I took during WBTB – waves/vibrations emanating from my head, disoriented and nauseous). When people spoke to me I could feel the sound waves enter my head/body and it was painful. I keep FA – waking up on the pillow/floor – I think I will never get lucid if people keep waking me up. Every time I would go “into a dreaming state consciously” I would get jolted out of it by painful sound waves. EOD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,,,,,Male,ID: hurd2015_pre:water details,05-26-2018,"3. I was in my hometown, old downtown area, walking around at night trying to get back to my car, wary of other people. I tried to see the new fountain. My car was parked on a side street behind the old movie theater. K. and I were going for a drive up a New England coastal town where there had been a recent fire. We were looking for the building where the fire had been. She was driving north and I saw it out the window, to the left, as we passed, and I yelled out, “There it was!” but had to laugh because it had already been torn down and we’d already passed it. We wandered around town and I was admiring a beautiful old tree with yellow bark in front of one of the town buildings (the library?). Walking under the tree, I noticed small round hard nuts. “Is this a beechnut?” I asked. I’m not sure if I got an answer. Later, w/ K. and H. on the lawn in front of a college dorm. Talking to K., I told her she could give me her address so we could stay in touch, but she didn’t comment and I could tell that it wouldn’t work, but that was ok. K. got up to go somewhere (bathroom?), and I decided I needed to go to. We were there for a performance or event, I think. Was this a co-ed dorm? I entered what was a small restaurant in the dorm, with old, ugly, wood-paneled walls. I looked around for the restroom, but wasn’t sure it was ok to go wandering through the building. I may have realized I was dreaming because, at some point, I thought, “What am I thinking? I can just go to my own bathroom.” I walked back outside. We had been planning on camping out on the ground, but no one else was there and I wondered if we should go. Two guys swooped down, nearly knocking H.over. Earlier, she was trying to get comfortable on the ground with a pillow. K. returned and did knock H. over, turning her into a squid, flopping around on the ground. K. suggested H. might have had a spinal injury the way she was moving about, but it was hard to know or communicate with her in her present form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,,,,,Female,ID: hurd2015_pre:shakti details,05-26-2018,"2. I am in the garage of a house that morphs between reminding me of my parents’ and Aunt A and Uncle L’s 1st Plantation house – except this one was cluttered not orderly like theirs is/was in WR. Someone is inside the garage with a baby and I am observing them – they aren’t taking very good care of him. There is a diaper changer and other baby items in the garage – like a nursery setup only with typical garage clutter. I think they can’t possibly let the baby sleep in here – they must only change his diaper in here. It’s dusk out now and I am standing in the driveway. I see rats going in an out of the garage. It’s getting darker outside. I go inside the garage and notice a baby carrier/car seat balanced between a coffee table and couch – it has a thin blanket over it. I think, “No… they wouldn’t leave the baby in it.” I peel back the blanket and see the baby sleeping. I pick him up and he starts to awaken. I am using a soothing voice and rubbing his backside. I feel his bottom and he is soaked – sitting in a dirty diaper. I think this is outrageous. I say, “It’s time to take a bath.” I am thinking how he could get bit by rats or get parasites from their droppings by being left in a rat infested garage. I go inside to bathe him and put on a clean diaper/clothes. I am back in the garage; the baby is older, just learning to walk. He is walking around all this clutter. I yell, “Look out!” A black, wooden shelving unit tipped over and almost crushed him. When I yelled the father turned around and caught the shelf before it could crush the child. I finally speak up, “This is no place for a child to be hanging out. Do you know there are rats in here? I saw rats going in and out of this garage!” He doesn’t seem to care. I think I should call child protective services because this seems like “gross neglect.” They not only keep the child in here, but also leave the garage open and the baby unattended, so anyone could just come in and take the kid. I observe rats going in and out again. Two rats get killed somehow – I didn’t see how it happened I just heard a strange, non-human, screechy type sound and when I turned around to see what it was I see 2 large rats writhing in the driveway – and then they were silent and still. I wonder how they died or were killed. EOD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kidlet #1 helps me find hubby as I need a head lamp. It's dark out and cloudy so won't see the trail without it. An argument ensues about who left my headlamp where so I go out on my skis and leave. Scene changes and I'm running in a city. At first I was in a mall and buying clothes but it turns into a marathon/obstacle course. I have to make sure my feet go around this narrow tube as I go upside down. I continue to run with a group of female friends I don't have IWL. I start to break free as they go shopping again. I realize I have no food or drink with me when I get past another narrow obstacle where I also have to write down 3 answers to two questions. I see Troy C lead the area but a small girl gives me 2 answers and tells me I only need to write those, so I do with purple crayon. I find my cousin Mere at a food stop. She is selling wieners and beans. It's $2.25 and I check my pocket but only have pennies. I know I need to fuel up to finish but tell her I can't pay, hoping as my cousin she'll pay for me. I dig into another pocket and find a twoonie and a quarter. I can pay and get some water. I ask others sitting at this area how far we have run as I see a 14 on a white paper posted on the wall. They all say we've gone 14 miles. I'm happy!! More than half way through. I know I've taken a bit over two hours to go 14 miles so can probably reach my goal of completing in under six hours.

I’m not sure why they’re there, and I try to act cool because I don’t want to be picked on by a bunch of children. They talk and one of them gives me a glass of water which I begin to drink. They start to leave and I notice what look like a bunch of dried up dog turds in the water. I yell at the kid who handed it to me and he says that it was just a joke. There’s a red-haired woman always in the peripheral of my vision, but every time I turn to look at her she disappears. It really starts to creep me out. At this point I become lucid and am outside. Four or five people are standing in a driveway. I tell them that “I’ll be coming back regularly,” meaning that I would be conscious in the dream world. I wait for a response but nobody says anything. They just look at me. Then a woman approaches me and gets real close to me. “Your name is Rosalyn,” she says. “Rose?” I ask. “No. Rosalyn.” She then walks away.

65,,,,,Male,ID: hurd2015_pre:vann details,05-26-2018,"1. I am at a party. I feel like I don’t quite belong, as everyone else there has some sort of title or ranking; for instance, one of the guests introduces themselves to the person next to me as a baronet and they do not ask for my name because I am nobody really important. The party has come to an end and I have two boxes of my things, mostly books, which I wish to bring as I am moving out of this place. The boxes are heavy and awkward though and I’m not sure how to carry them. A black girl helps me, and her and I carry the boxes outside and through the neighborhood. When she is done I suggest she goes home. She does not know how to get there herself but I see a cop and she heads to him so he can escort her back and make sure she does not get lost. I find a nice looking porch and decide to sit. A man walks up to the porch and looks at me, bemused. He then sits on the porch next to me and stares. I realize that this must be his house and I quickly get up. He still seems a little irritated but also good humored as he strikes up conversation with me. We are sitting in front of a large pit in front of his house, and I sit on the side of it, my legs dangling over. I’m a little worried that I’m going to fall in. He asks if I’ve been to Africa, as he’s been there recently. He says that it has changed quite a lot since the last time he went, which was the last election (when the democratic party had not won). He looks exhausted, with red, cracked eyes, and he says this is because he had crossed a giant bridge and asks me if I’ve ever been on it. I have not been there either but I think I know the one he was talking about – a miles-long green pedestrian bridge going above the water outside the city. I jump into the pit, which is about four or five feet below, and we play a game like pool, hitting balls into the holes in the corners. My cousin is there and he and I decide to go somewhere else. We begin walking and all the sudden everything around us looks kind of hazy and I think we’re in a news report about a terrorist attack or a scene of a movie. I look at the building where there should be a panda express but it’s just a picture of a panda, and I say, “See? There isn’t the name ‘Panda Express’ because then that would be copyright infringement, so this must be a movie after all.” We continue walking and I’m really happy to be spending time with him. I’m about to suggest that we should go find somewhere to eat when he spots Y and a female friend by a cart. He rushes over to them and I follow behind, reluctantly. They begin to walk and another group of my cousin’s friends join him. They are all walking quickly now and I have to rush to keep up, as they’re leaving me behind. They stop at a gate and line up, unsure of where it is leading. We get inside and it is a continuation of the park, but with cover above, and we’re told that it’s a preview of some kind of new ‘green’ oxygen experience. The entrance fee is four dollars and we each pay. The woman taking our money asks if I’ve ever been here before, and I say no. She then asks if I’ve used a ‘poop grinder’. I see instructions in a handbook about what that is and look to my right to see a woman squatting inside of a box over a large mechanism which grinds her feces so that it instantly becomes fertilizer. This is absolutely disgusting and I feel a little sick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walked down to beaches and street with broken glass, woman tried to take a spoon. With Chad and other groups of people going to take their picture? I wanted to go to this one hill, I also go to in dreams. We do and get some awesome pics then come across some barnyard type deal with people. One of my cousins getting married. Turns out to be having a big party outside. I am not into it or feeling social. I go outside a back yard and sit by a creek. There is a girl there who is by me. She is a ghost. She let me have one of her bikes, her mom killed her in a car accident. She goes and breaks a lock and gives me a bike that is yellow feathered, like an ostrich. I ride it around. Party goes on for a while. Chad and I go walking on a path (I am becoming more aware that I am dreaming) and we are swimming in air. I have to go up to brunch, then we come to a tourist spot with two other people and two old women selling things. They take a picture of us with this little card usb type deal, one time use. Chad did not want it and we head back to the party, I guess. Back at the party, that goes on. Chad is in a white and blue boat going around in circles to pick me up and John Whitman was with him. I would go inside to the party. The last part I remember is having to have to sub teacher. We tricked some guy not to do it for $100. Me, Harry, black twin standing in line finding something.

And I feel like I was walking through items and stairs, looking for my class that was watching a movie. I wanted to learn though. I had much confidence in everything. I was off in some nature area, looking like Southern California. There is a huge cliff. I am so determined to climb it and reach the top. Again I have much confidence in myself and I do make it to the top, but it is unfinished. At the top is a hole going back down to the ground and then the trail. So it is just a gap. So I let go and just slide back down. I am with friends who own land and a house, then oddly I am with some guy I went to middle school with, Vincent. He liked me and we were dating – he made it clear. We were riding bikes together to the friend’s house/land (which was that guy Evan dated), he would tell me everything is okay. He will always take care of me. I remember a great feeling being in his arms. We begin to kiss and become sexual. The floors in the house were hardwood with long hallways with two empty rooms, we rode bikes around. I would ride the bike on the road, but then it turns into a hovering fan I am sitting on. I make a sudden turn not to get on the interstate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had filled it up with suds and candles, about to smoke pot and soak when I saw a barbecue roll by the window. I throw on clothes and bring it inside, excited to show Chad. He later comes over and likes it, but it had fallen in my bath water. I was sad because I wanted us to take one together. I am with my brother who was telling us how he fell down and passed out before, that happened again, someone saved him. I stopped to cry and hug him telling him how that made me feel. He wants to get better. His stomach and ribs were so tiny and enclosed, like he had an eating disorder, but I could feel his love. Chad and I are in the van when some fat black man tries to steal the van and us. He was very slow and made the mistake of leaving and I was able to lock him out, ended up we were in Hollywood and some producer wanted me to be in a show. It is known that I have a lot of money, I am way up in the hills and there are trees all around with hiking paths. It was very beautiful. Justin and I are talking to a real estate agent person, saying how we wanted to build big hotels and make it a party scene. We say no. it’s for our dad and we want a little log cabin by the water source. As we finish I slide down a steep ground path back down, my purse is there filled with pot. I am back in my parents’ kitchen talking to them about Justin and how I will do whatever he wants, but somehow along the way it turns out to be Richard. He and navy buddies are in town getting a nice hotel room on the top floor with a view, Spoon will be there. So I go with him ($35 a night each). He and I start to drive through the desert, it is strange and deserted. We go the wrong way and turn around. We make it to the hotel and meet up with his buddies. Spoon had grown up a lot. We end up getting in an airplane or helicopter. I remember the view was incredible! It was an abstract interpretation of a western city, you could see whales in the water (this made me tell everyone how I saw a dolphin out surfing). Then I started to get really nervous about being up high in a plane, but then I just told myself, “Stay calm, there is no need to panic, what will happen, will happen and take responsibility for your actions.” We get to the room and there is some sort of secret headquarters. An older woman is trying to hide it. Behind our room was one filled with mattresses you could buy. Some girl was telling me how worthy it was to buy one there, laying on one that was made up of shredded newspaper (amazing). I was going to make my own bed out of pillows, so I did not have to sleep next to anyone else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I grab them and put them off to safety at a house halfway to my parents’ at the top of the hill. I keep running and make it in, but I am now inside my California apartment running to my room. But that's when the bear turned from a black bear to “big foot” who was huge, white and gray with a somewhat human face. I was trapped on my bed. He would not let me leave. Oh yeah, he talked. I could not yell for help. All sorts of people were over from visiting my parents. Some girl tried to negotiate with him. People started to throw chairs. He knew this would do nothing. He was not hurting me. Ah, it’s hazy how I got him out. He turned into a rug the shape of a turtle shell and threw it down the stairs. But the door would not lock all the way. He came back in, but I feel like we were just able to ask him to leave. Hazy. I am working in some weird warehouse type place. Turns out Obama is coming. He owns some sort of drink line. We start to restock it. He comes down and he is just like a normal black dude who is cool. Then later on I see him again at a parking lot. He is with a girl. We meet up, exchange a few words and he heads off.

But then they come in more and more, bigger, stronger, faster, more powerful than ever before, knocking over cars and buildings, washing people away. Everyone getting more scared. I keep telling people we need to get away from the coast, we have to head east. I keep looking at maps of Europe. Finding little shacks. Everyone is trying to get plane tickets. I am in the van with other people, trying to survive the water pouring in. The sides start to collapse – the water had already taken away Chad and he had died. I was okay with him being gone. The van eventually gets destroyed and I start to make it more inland. People giving away vouchers for hotels – talked to Jeff on the phone at some point. My old friend Kathleen was there. She was very scared and needed comfort.

We took them and started to throw them at the trees and various things, then a guy and his son pull up in a truck and ask us what we are doing. We reply, “Ya know nothing, just throwing these.” He asked us why and we said that we were bored. Then he started to yell at us telling us to leave. Then I yelled at him, “Fuck you, start the revolution, Ron Paul!” And he goes, “Did you just say Ron Paul?” and shook his head. Then later on Mike and I were walking in the same area. We came up to this really cool house and decided to break in. It was uphill and he would have to drive his jeep through there and through a fence and hole. So he does. We go in but do not rob it. Then my friend Cindy calls and tells us that the house we are in belongs to the two guys talking to us earlier, and they are on their way home! We start to freak out. We hear a knock on the door but it was just Steven in a sweater and goofy glasses. We yell at him to leave. In the midst of all of this I find a bunch of tiny white kittens. We debate if we should take them or not. We don't and then just butt out of there like a very dramatic movie scene. We get all the cars out in time using pulleys. There is dramatic theme music playing. They all drive off as I am climbing down, and start to run like crazy. Then all of a sudden I am in a downtown area. People drove by in a 1920's car laughing at me. Later I met up with everyone and we had made it out safe.

I was part of the secret service and mark cohen, a journalist, was sitting next to me in the row and he just couldn't listen to trumps bs anymore so he put both hands on Donald's throat and starts strangling. He did that thing in movies where the one guy is talking so much but his voice is getting quieter because the other character is drowning tuning him out because he can't listen anymore like he's having this realization then mark puts both hands around his throat and I grab mark. We tumble over the front row. The movie we we were wartchjng was some black and white cowboy film. I think I'm going to become a national hero and somehow everyone hears about it but when it's time to acknowledge me in front of everyone I'm standing in a room on the upper balcony in what's supposed to be congress for this big savior acknowledgment and instead it's more like a giant sea world place with tall glass behind the presidents podium and everyone knows I saved Donald trump even my dad who's super proud of me. And we're all waiting for Donald to acknowledge my heroics on national tv and instead he thanks the second guy the second agent who jumped in after I already pulled mark cohen the journalist off him. And I say I'm the hero and that's classic Donald. He shook my hand and thanks you to your face but he can't acknowledge he really was helped so he'd rather acknowledge a fake narrative where he wasn't really helped. Where the actual person who helped him. Because he just likes giving big fuck yous to everyone with a big smile on his face. And as I said that Barack obama is standing next to me and he does this acknowledgment frown as soon as Donald acknowledges the other guy and slowly pulls out a crumpled pack of camel lights and gives me one. I handle it really gently because i want to save it for when I drink later at the party. I almost break it and bend it to where it's not smokeable. And I get nervous. Then I see barack walking out from the audience bleachers where we all are. He's all hunched over and he looks really defeated. And I feel bad for him. Then some guy crashes into the audience from a Segway scooter thing. He's got his hair dyed like that trendy gray silver anime color everyone is doing now. He yells ""hey everyone did you know the new mountains of margar is out"" and this other nerd in the audience says ""mountains of margar? I believe it is called the chapter of margargh"" like there was some subtle difference in pronunciation and it's like the biggest fantasy hit in the world. So I never get my secret service acknowledgment officially but everyone knows it was me and congress ends at sea world kind of place then turns into dungeons and dragons convention. Amd the nerds were really annoying. I don't know what happened to mark cohen he was taken away and never heard from again but in the news he was disgraced. Oh and I remember being on tv and going to shake Donald's hand and my friends all hated me I didn't resist or something like throw shit at him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Prog,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For most of the dream, I was with Donald J. trump (Trump). He didn't say much, but seemed to walk with me wherever I went, though it could be I was following him around. There was some kind of a ball planned for a little later, for which many photos had been printed on sheets of paper about two meters wide. I was annoyed with myself for not doing this with one of my photos, because mine could have been chosen as the image used to promote the event. Trump says something like""come with me"", which I took to be an invitation to eat lunch with him. It felt like something we'd done before, but it only happened once in the dream. I walk with Trump, but as we walk, I run into a student who wants some feedback from me. He shows an animation of some cubes and cylinders tumbling down a hill, but it looks like he hand animated them instead of using a dynamics program. This lowered the quality of the result and also got in the way of finishing the project, which he hadn't done. (Due to problems with my dream journal program, I sent this as email to myself and am finishing the dream record as an email which I will forward to myself) While sitting with the student, I say that his project should be complex enough to be a legitimate challenge to himself. His project had many objects in it that could be described as complex because they were numerous, but the problem they represented was simple, so the project was not a legitimate challenge. As I said this, I noticed Trump nodding his head seriously as if in agreement. We then left the student and kept walking. When we came to a metal staircase, it occurred to me that the school year was almost over (it is currently exactly half over). My impression was that in a month or so, it would be summer. I say something on this subject, namely, that in the years before Trump arrived (the current year) the years went by much more slowly. When we get to street level, a limo comes for Trump. He gets in and I follow. As we drive, someone calls him on the phone. He says ""okay, you've got fifteen seconds and then I have to let you go"". This was the amount of time before we got to our destination. When we get out, I decide to tell Trump that I like the title of his book ""The art of the deal"". I explain that I enjoyed nothing more than making deals when I was a kid, then proceeded to explain how I made my comic book collection back in the 1970's.

Although I could not see him clearly, there was no doubt it was he. Then he was sitting on the edge of the sofa in the living room. It was as if he had just come in and taken a seat, but was not interested in leaning back and sitting for a while. He was not interested in conversation. It was as if he were waiting for me to do something to help him. I knew immediately what it was he needed, I just did not know why he chose me. Then I immediately thought he was weary and looked tired. I was overtaken with sorrow for him, and was overwhelmed with compassion for him and his situation. I felt he urgently needed my help. He desperately needed my help, and there was no doubt about that in my mind. I kept thinking: Why is this wealthy, wealthy man in my house? Why is he here with me? He can rest anywhere in the world. I then had a stronger feeling that he was exhausted, thirsty, and just plain worn out as if he had been fighting in a battle. He just needed a place to lay his head. It was as if he was an officer far from his headquarters and was using a local residence to stop by as in the olden days. I just kept thinking over and over: Why would he stop here looking for a place to rest? My house is not suitable for guests, especially someone like him. I have not even cleaned up in a while. I was embarrassed because I did not have a fancy place to accommodate this prosperous businessman. I finally realized that he knew he could find safe haven in my home. He knew I would welcome him and not turn him away. He knew that I knew he had been in battle. I then felt he needed water too. I went to the kitchen to try to find a fancy glass to put water in. I remember turning on the tap and thinking this water is not fit for him. My family and I don’t even drink it. I did not want to give him a bottle of water either. That would be really tacky. I then looked at my glasses and thought they looked dirty. I don’t exactly remember, but it seems like I finally did give him some water in a glass. Then I told myself: You have to prepare a bed.Now.There is no time to waste. Don’t keep him waiting. I went to another room and was trying to straighten the bed and covers. I thought there were debris, books, and other stuff everywhere, and I was picking if off, trying to find a place to put it. I thought the floor needed vacuuming. I wanted it to be clean, but I thought there was no time for that. I simply had to show him where he could rest, and I had to do it quickly. I went back to the living room, and it was completely dark. I did not see him or his face at first, then as I was looking down on him, he leaned back and looked toward the light from the lamp to look at me, and I could clearly see it was he. His hair was even that classic looking strawberry blondish-grayish-brown. After he saw that it was I, he backed out of the light but was still sitting on the sofa. I knew he would not move until I gave him directions. I reached out to take him by the hand to lead him to the room I had prepared. I clearly remember touching the top of his hand. He nudged my hand away as if to say: I can get up. I’m not that old yet. At first I was a little offended, but then I thought it was just his ego. Nevertheless, I knew without a doubt he would not refuse a place to rest and waited for me to show him the way. I remember feeling happy that he needed my help, and I was willing to help him.

There were dogs in my dream... at one point, everyone had left the house but me and i found two dog in a bowl or bucket of water. They were laying one on top the other. i thought they'd drowned, but were alive. at the end of the dream i recall trying to find Trump to let him know that his dogs were alive...

315,,,,,Female,ID: td2017:td148 details,04-07-2017,"I was in a seemingly ordinary room, white-walled and minimally furnished, when something unusual caught my eye. Near the leg of a chair was a tiny little human, no more than two inches high. Closer inspection revealed that it was Donald Trump! Trying to figure out what was going on, I remembered hearing that this room had been designed as a sort of art installation by the punk rock impresario Malcolm MacLaren. All the furniture was subtly oversized in order to make one feel smaller, maybe even bring back memories of navigating the grown-up world as a child. But what I was seeing now was a much greater shift of scale than I would have expected. Just how big is this furniture, if it makes a grown man look only two inches tall? I knew that Malcolm MacLaren had been rich, but it would have cost a fortune to build an installation to a scale like that! Then I realized that my scale was perfectly ordinary in relation to the furniture, which could mean only one of two things. If the furniture were vastly oversized, then I too must be an enormous giant, so that if I left this room I would be blundering through the city like godzilla... but that seemed unlikely. I was pretty sure that I remembered being in ordinary scale to the world outside this room. The other possibility was that Donald Trump is actually only two inches tall. That made a lot more sense, given the extent of his overcompensatory bluster. I wondered if it might help if other people came to perceive this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Lib,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eric was steering the craft at first to show me how to do it. Then it was my turn. I took over the craft and started to bring it down to the ground below. It seemed like some kind of helicopter but very small as it only fit me and Eric side by side. When we landed I jumped off and Eric stayed on taking the craft back up. The moment I turn around I notice that I am now in an all white setting. The walls were white with columns leading to curved arches and they stretched around an enormous square plaza that had what looked like a white woven carpet for a floor. I then noticed that I was being guided around this area by Donald Trump, who seemed to be treating me as an honored guest. He showed me around and introduced me to people. We seemed to be talking candidly but I cannot recall what about. After we left the great white plaza Donald guided me through what seemed to be a naval vessel. We kept going up until we reached a compartment that appeared to be multi-functional. Donald left me at a table with close to a dozen people, all who had communication devices in their ears. They were testing these devices and one of the devices had a distorted sound. Everyone there seemed to know me as they looked to me to figure out what was wrong with the device. I spoke into the microphone and made a few comments and then woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Con,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
317,,,,,Female,ID: td2017:td145 details,04-07-2017,"Me and a lot of other people were watching a film about Donald while he was in the theatre with us. The movie theater was located within a super market, or sort of in the basement of one. Under a table above the theater was someone from my old school who could ask people downstairs if they wanted snacks through a wormhole. Near where I was sitting was this hot man who had a girlfriend and he looked a bit like Brian Cox (just a lot better), so I was sort of hitting on him. Donald paused the film but he never told us how long the break would be. The boy under the table was selling some more stuff when we got upstairs, but I kind of wanted to step outside for some fresh air, when the cute guy's girlfriend (or fiancée) asked him to get something from the car, so naturally I walked with him. We were all wearing pyjama's and comfy slippers, and it was freezing outside (though it didn't feel cold). Outside, he went to his car and I saw two people who were also from my old school but they ignored me (I felt embarrassed because of my pyjamas). Then my best friend came up to me with some other people and said he got a text that Donald was angry because we missed the beginning of the second half of the film, and we had two options: pay a fine of thousands of euros, or make a rhyme with a lot of ""I""-sounds. My friend and I both decided to go for a rhyme because there was lots you could do with it like ""I missed you"" and ""clit"" to express regret (I don't even know why). Then I beckoned pretty boy over to tell him about the text, but he had gotten it as well, so we went back to the theater and everyone was sort or rooting for me while I did my poem. I think I was hanging upside down? Donald seemed happy enough anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Lib,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
318,,,,,Female,ID: td2017:td42 details,04-07-2017,"If I remember correctly, I fell asleep yesterday afternoon watching the CNN previews to the RNC. I dreamed that Donald Trump had been a family friend for years and was about to marry into my family. We were walking together in the streets of another city--maybe Washington, DC--Trump, some of his entourage, me, and some of my family, and it was the eve or first day of the RNC. I felt that I knew Trump and even loved him as a family friend, but still there was no way that I could vote for him. I didn't know if I'd told him this yet. We started to turn down into an alley full of colorful protest signs and campaign signs, and I could see a huge group of protesters coming from the other side of the alley. The alley wasn't dark or too enclosed. I wasn't frightened, but apprehensive of how the group and Trump would greet each other. Trump and the others in our group slowly backed away and started walking down the main street to avoid the protesters--wisely, I thought--but I lingered, reading the signs posted on the fence. The signs were on posterboard, white, hot pink, and other colors, and there may have been a more formal printed sign with a list of rules. Also, some barrier was erected, like a piece of wrought-iron fencing or a rope, that would slow down the protesters. I got to thinking, ""He's already married, so whom could he be marrying? My Aunt Edna? Maybe one of my cousins or one of my distant cousins."" Later, I was in some political office looking out the window watching people mill around on the street below. I was probably on the second or third floor. Actually, the street was nearly empty, wet, like just after a rainstorm, with some protest signs and political handouts lying in the streets. I felt we were in Washington, DC. I think this was an office full of anti-Trump liberals. I walked through several busy offices full of paper. A woman seated at a large wooden desk, and on the phone, mentioned Trump. She was white, bespectacled, thin maybe, middle-aged. I think she wanted to interview him or to confront him or give him a piece of her mind. I thought of mentioning that I knew Trump and might get him for an interview, but I decided not to name-drop and thought that he might be too busy for such an interview anyway, or not interested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Lib,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They get back from Watseka Avenue, the Tucson gem show, and expect me to hang around with them, and work for them. Instead, I befriend a dysfunctional new devotee and try to help her get set up. She currently rents a room near Watseka Avenue for $500 a week ($2,100 a month) and I try to get her a room and a job on Watseka. We run into a devotee who can get her a job and it turns out they both know some ancient hand symbol language. They start to communicate in hand language. I was supposed to spend the day with Jan and Ron, but got mad. They were so picky and pushy. I wanted to pick out some drinks but they said to wait twenty minutes. Instead, I put the bottles back on the display and walk away from them and go off with this new person. Later, after she meets this man and we're talking about hiring her, he says she doesn't dress very well. He says the soul is disturbed if it can't dress right. I say, ""I have that too and I'm okay!"" And ""Look at you - what is that?"" He's wearing a zip-up sweatshirt with a windbreaker over it. When she and the man hit it off, I get out my cell phone to call Jan and Ron. I left them all day. Either they gave up on me or they're really mad that I disappeared. (I wake up).

443,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'8. December 15, 1587. The fifteenth of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and took me to the seashore, where I met the two fishermen I know, and the Lion Man told me: “Have they revealed to you the tree vision from last night?” I nodded and he asked me who did. I answered that Don Alonso de Mendoza did. I told him everything that Don Alonso has explained to me according to his understanding. He said: “Well done, but I will tell you the same with less words: “The tree trunk represents the king, the branches are his army and the leaves are people. The crow brought a leaf to Drake, which is a sign that he is receiving messages from Spain. Losing branches, which are handed to Drake, means the army is going to lose. Those shattered tiny pieces of wood, flying and killing people who were shooting at them, means that the army is going to defend itself and will hurt our enemies.” And when he finished explaining this, he ordered the Ordinary Man to take me where he had told him. And he took me to the south, to a very high and very dry island where I could not see any man or tree or green thing in the soil or any water, only land like white sand and like very parched fields in the summer. And when I arrived at this island, I raised my eyes to the sky, which looked very dark and cloudy, as the ones in the summer, although there was not a storm, only a cloudy and quiet sky. And while I was looking at it, I saw the two fishermen coming from the same place from which I had come; and releasing from his hand the leash that tied up the lion, the Lion Man said: “Ok, go, I do not want to bring more signs, it is enough with the one I showed you in order to know me, and if not, it does not matter.” And the lion kneeled down in front of him and he blessed the animal, which left roaring loudly. I said: “I will not dare to walk around this island as the lion is on it.” And the man that left the lion free said: “Do not be afraid, even if you run into him, he will not hurt you. Look, I have been asked by my friend here to show you these visions, and I have shown them to you to obey him.” You can see well here that there are not any trees nor any green grass in this field. And pointing to a small piece of land with his hand, he said: “Be aware that what is grown here, although it looks small and is small, it means a lot. And I saw that a very small and thin tree was growing from that piece of land that he was pointing to; and it had a new shape, with no leaves, it looked more like a tiny dry stick than a tree. And then from the east, on my left side, I saw a small river (without much current), which looked more like a creek with very clear water; and another three rivers coming from the west, north and south in the same way. And all of them flowed towards it, and the water pushed the lion, surrounding him. And with all this water coming from everywhere, this tiny tree was rising from the earth and growing in a short time; it grew so much that it became a very big and exuberant tree with plenty of branches and lots of fruits, with more fruits than leaves. I looked at the fruit and I thought they were muscatel pears, which were nice, big and aromatic; and their fragrance spread everywhere in the fields in such a way that you were happy to be there. And I saw that there were many other small trees growing up from this tree trunk, all around it and side by side from the same soil (as if they were its sons), in a very short time; and some have some fruits like the big tree (as they were watered by the creek), and some others only have leaves as they were in dry land and the water seemed to run far away from them. And the Lion Man said to me: “You will tell what you have seen in this dream to the man that showed you the other dream.” And I again looked around the island and I saw that it was blooming, green, and fresh as a garden; as it was now crowded with trees, descendants of that first tree, which were there with all the creeks that run everywhere. And all my three companions disappeared and I awoke…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
444,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'31. March 7, 1588. The seventh of March of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and told me: “Would you like to go where the two companions are? Do not think that I talked to you that way to worry you!” I got up to go with him, and walking on the street, I saw many stone statues, and the Ordinary Man said to me: “What do you think these statues want to be? These are the bad ones and, being this year the one in which God is sending his wrath to all people, first he goes for the really malicious ones.” Going towards the palace, we walked by a wolf without feet and hands, and the Ordinary Man said to me: “This one was thrown away through the bridge arches as were the incredulous people, as I have already repeated many times.” “Take me to the seashore where the two companions are.” The Old Fisherman said: “Do you remember the arch you saw in the sky? Well, listen, it is a sign of big floods and storms that will stir the sea waters.” And after he said this, the Old Man disappeared and we did not see him that night in that place. And then the Lion Man called me and told me: “Do you not know that all of Argel will come to Valencia soon? This will be in the months when the gardens grow flowers for you to enjoy; and if in the month of April the Armada stops in the sea, its entire people will die of the plague, and they will leave all those ships to Don Anthony’s people. And if these people leave, as I mentioned to you before, the foreign navy will be able to use force to destroy its captains and will leave with some galleys to the Portuguese islands.” And then he said: “Did you tell Don Alonso what you heard the Great Turk saying?” I nodded and asked him: “What was the dispute that the Ordinary Man mentioned?” He answered me: “Did not Fray Luke and Don Alonso have one? There was also one in the palace. Listen! I have already warned you that you should be safe and go away to where I have told you to be cautious.” He asked me to look at the sky and there I saw three figures: of Christ on the cross, two archbishops, and Peter the apostle (whose facial features looked similar to the Old Fisherman that I usually see here on earth), and I also saw a pope dressed in a habit of the order of Saint Francis, who was being abused by the archbishops. And while this was happening, I saw that these crosses were sweating blood, and I asked the Lion Man who was there with me: “Why are the crosses sweating like this?” “Because they have been isolated on earth and have drunk again from the chalice from which he drank in the garden; and those are the three that made miracles on earth; and God will have them hidden until Spain becomes peaceful; and it was this pope’s fault that those saintly bodies are hurting, that is why Saint Peter is judging him. And this abuse is not happening on earth but in the heavens.” And after he said that, the vision disappeared, leaving the sky full of blood; and the earth was shaking; and many lions and tigers were coming out of their caves, roaring, and they went to refresh themselves in the sea waters. And the Lion Man said: “It is still not the time to forgive you.” I saw that these tigers and lions, after digging with their claws, went into the ground. And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
445,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'12. December 21, 1587. The twenty first of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and I saw that he was carrying a skull in his hands and I told him: “Why are your bringing this skull?” He answered: “It is for those that study in order for them to study.” “What do you mean?” And he took me to the seashore where the other two companions were, and the Lion Man asked me: “What did Don Alonso say about the hazelnut tree?” I answered him: “I have not seen him so I could not ask him, however, I have seen Fray Luke, who has told me that this tree has the same meaning as the one that was shoved aside with no fruits. What do you think about Fray Luke’s opinion?” And he answered “Nothing,” and then they took me to the Old Fisherman, who said to me: “Marquis of Santa Cruz’s powerful army comes towards England.” And he ordered the Ordinary Man to take me where he had asked him. And taking me to the sea, I saw the Marquis’ army going to England. And I turned around towards my companion and asked him: “What is happening with these wars because I have not seen any city destroyed around here?” He answered me: “You do not understand; explain this to whom tells you these things, they will understand.” And then, I was in Turkey and I saw that the Great Turk’s army was leaving for Poland, and I saw him and Drake in a ship behind all the ships and galleys (as the Turkish lady advised him in another dream that I had). And from there the army was taken to Poland and I saw that Maximilian, the Empress’s son, was very upset because he did not have enough people and half the kingdom was against him. And I saw him asking his uncle, king Philip, for a favor. And my companion told me: “This is a loss for Spain because if he sends help to his nephew, the enemies will fall all over him.” From there he took me to Spain and placed me in a room where king Philip was; he was cleaning some swords from his gun room and my companion said to me: “Do you think that you are in Madrid? It is Toledo where you are. There is no need to clean the sword because you will die within sixty-four days, in the same month when your wife Elizabeth died.” After he said this, I saw Toledo sieged by the Moorish, the Turks, the French, English, and Polish, and I saw that they fiercely fought against the city by land and that nobody came to defend it. I heard that there was a herald in the city, he was well willed and dressed in brown; he was asking for volunteers to defend the city who would receive big gifts from the king. At this point, I saw a medium-sized man standing up: he was fit with a dark and well-defined face; and with this one, two hundred men all together armed themselves, and they had big white crosses on their armor. These crosses were so big that they covered their whole chest from side to side; they were as wide as the breast itself. And I saw that they left passing through the city door towards Madrid (right in front of that area there is plenty of flat land). And they killed so many enemies that the ones left alive escaped through that door; and this happened in the afternoon. And this man wanted to get together with all their soldiers in the city; and he counted one hundred men dead. And when they entered the city walls and were there, they heard a big noise among the people. They said that king Philip was dead, and this man not only ordered this news not to be announced in the city to prevent enemies from cheering up and suddenly attacking again, but also to bury his body with privacy. And I saw that the funeral was done and I saw the cardinal Quiroga, with black clothing, and other priests that I did not know were carrying him on their shoulders. And the archbishop had a white band tied to his forehead and over his eyes, and as I saw him in this condition, I asked the Ordinary Man who was there with me: “Is that man with that cloth sick?” He answered me: “That one and the Marquis de Au\xf1on (either one or the other or both) will die soon.” And I saw that the king was taken from the Alcazar to the main church and was placed in a chapel below the principal altar. And this funeral was done without ringing any bells. After this, I saw that the man, who left the city to defend it with those two hundred men, had met those one hundred left alive with another two hundred, and with these three hundred was ready to leave by another city door that opened to the land facing Madrid, (there were slopes in front and on the sides of this land) to fight with the enemies; and there he killed and took many prisoners. From here he took me to the seashore so I could not see the end of the battle. I told the Old Fisherman everything I saw because he asked me to. He said to me: “I asked you because if you repeat it again you will not forget it.” Then the Lion Man called me and asked me: “Would you like to see a vision from my hand? Don Alonso will be pleased to see it.” I agreed and he took me up in the air to where the seashore was and showed me a big bush over the water, close to the shore. And I saw it burning in a big fire, with clear flames and without smoke. And I saw that in the middle of this fire there was a beautiful angel (in a man’s shape and dressed as the images painted adoring our Saint Mary) with the upper part of his body showing about the flames and swinging his wings very fast over that fire. I did not understand whether he did so in order to either put the fire down or to stoke it to burn the bush faster. Nevertheless, I saw that the fire was eventually extinguished without leaving any mark on the bush. And then, the angel, the fire and the bush disappeared; and I saw that there was a corpse left in that same place, covered with a white shroud which was scorched after being in the fire. And meanwhile, I saw that the sea became rough from the east with big tall waves coming towards the place where this dead body was, taking him away towards the west. The Lion Man, who was showing me this vision, said to me: “Come on, go; God bless you, and tell what you saw!” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
446,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'5. December 6, 1587. The sixth of December of this year the Ordinary Man appeared and brought me a red clay jar, similar to a Zamora earthenware pitcher, with two handles and a long neck, and he asked me to notice the four holes that it had in the neck, besides another one at the very top of the neck, a total of five holes; and asked me to drink from it, from one of the holes on the side, not from the top one. And I drank. After the Ordinary Man took the pitcher and passed it to another man by his side; noticing this, I asked the Ordinary Man: “This water is yours, isn’t it?” And he answered that it was not his water but a friend of Aguiar’s; “He knows he loves you very much that is why he brought you this water, and he wants to tell you what kind of water this is for you to tell everybody. This water was collected on the morning of Saint John before sunrise and has to be from a running stream or river over land.” I asked him what the meaning was of the red star that I have seen on previous nights; and the man over the buffalos. He answered that the man over the buffalos represented fair justice to come. He asked me to look outside the window facing north, there you will see a star. I looked and saw a star in the sky in the same place where I have seen a star sinking in the sky, leaving a hole behind. He asked me if I knew about that star. I answered by saying that this star was the one representing the king Philip. And then I saw a lot of armed men coming from the west, and a lot of serpents and snakes, with other poisonous animals coming from the north, and the latter fighting with the armed people. They were fighting with each other; however, none of them was winning. Then from the south, I saw some animals that looked like wolves in their hair color, body, and shape, and they came barking like dogs; they bit the armed man’s ankles with their teeth, making them fall dead on the floor; and they could not reach the snakes. This is how the battle was finished. And the Ordinary Man asked me to go to bed. And turning to me, he said: “Tell those people to whom you reveal your dreams that they need to study this star meaning.” And I saw that close to the Ordinary Man was the man in chains who I have seen on previous nights and I asked him whether he was Piedrola. He responded: “Who is Piedrola?” I responded that he is a prophet, and as such he is appreciated in court, although he is in prison. Without saying a word, this man turned to the Ordinary Man, that was present there, and asked him for his permission to show me another vision with him, and the Ordinary Man gladly agreed. He took me to a window in my house, facing south, from which I saw two men from another dream; they said they represented Moses and Eli. From the window, coming down the street from the east, I saw twelve young women beautifully dressed and adorned with silks, a lot of gold, precious stones and pearls. They did not look like Spaniards as they were showing part of their breasts in the same fashion as foreign women usually are portrayed in paintings. They walked, passing below my window towards west. Behind them, there was a very pretty woman (big and tall as a giant) whose body and look seemed to be like the representation of those called Roman Midwives. This one had the left breast naked with a snake around it, and in her head she had a big bun (like the one used by country women in the mountains) with locks of snakes intertwined with each other. Her sleeves, rolled up, were showing half her arms (hairy and strong like a man’s), and her elbows, and she was carrying common copper cauldrons full of water in every hand. When she was in front of my window, she stopped and she shouted out loudly, not as if she were complaining but as if she were calling someone, and then she said: “Although I am on earth, my voice will be heard in heaven.” Then I saw that, after her loud cry, every man from all the nations in the world, from every corner, came to surrender close to her. Then when they were in front of her, she said to the people of Spain (I knew they were Spaniards because of their faces and clothing): “Drink thirsty people, your shepherd has left you without water and you are dry.” And I saw how these people furiously rushed to drink from the cauldrons; and when she saw that they were satiated, she shouted out again as before without saying a word. And I saw that all the small birds in the world came to her, surrounding her, and she said: “Drink, as you have also been taken away from your nests, that have caused no harm at all in this world.” And I saw that these small birds also came down to drink from the cauldrons, and after drinking, they flew to her breast and head, and from there they flew away. And this giant woman kept walking down the street towards the west, now with her cauldrons empty, making a lot of noise with them as she was rushing to catch the other women in front of her. And then I saw that, from the same place where the giant woman came, from the east, a man was walking down the street. He was dressed in black, his face and body similar to the giant women, big and tall, but not as handsome as her, because he was black. And when he arrived below my window, in the same spot where the giant woman was, he stopped and shouted out, saying: “With this voice, I will make all the snakes and wild animals come to me.” And I saw lots of lions, tigers, wolves, many serpents, alligators, frogs, snakes and other poisonous animals coming from everywhere. They surrounded this man and I saw how he converted himself into a fountain, in such a way that from every part of his body there were pipes of clear water running out. And I saw how the beasts, after drinking from him, changed the water into blood; and the serpents and snakes and other poisonous animals came and wallowed in it, leaving it dirty and black, as muddy waters being shaken. And at that very instant, I saw that these two men (mentioned above, called Eli and Moses) were side by side with this man converted into a fountain and said: “Indeed, we have come on time for everyone to take his snake.” And I saw how Eli took an alligator and Moses took a frog. And at the same time, I asked the chained man who was there with me: “Is that one, Moses, (whom I mentioned to you before) the Ordinary Man that keeps me company, is it not him?” As soon as I said that, the man, to whom I was referring to, lifted his hand to his face and scrubbed himself, turning his face white. And I said: “There is no point in doing that, I know you well.” I turned to the chained man and asked him: “Do you know him?” And he told me to look at this man myself, as he did not want to get involved in the matter. And then the man who had brought all the ferocious animals and snakes disappeared. And Moses and Eli stood there; and sat below my window where I was. And Moses turned the frog upside down and put his hand on the frog belly and said to Eli: “Do you know that last night I was in a castle, the tallest in the world, and I took this person with me, who was very scared to be there? Nevertheless, in order for me to take this person there again and make her lose her fear, I have to show her all the kingdoms in such a way as I am showing this frog belly now.” After hearing that, I turned around to the chained man who was by my side and told him: “This man speaks like the other one that keeps me company.” And the chained man replied: “Look, I do not know him.” After saying this, he took me away from the window and back to my bed, where I found the Ordinary Man by the bedside and asked him: “Is it true that you look like another man called Moses?” And he responded: “Leave me alone, do not get me involved in that.” And I stared at him, realizing that he brought the pumpkin and the leather bag that I saw him carrying before and asked him: “why are you carrying a pumpkin?” And he answered: “Do not you remember when I fed you from this pumpkin flesh?” And I asked him: “Why are you carrying a leather bag?” He answered that it was to show that he was not a man of our time. And after he said that, he disappeared. The chained man was present while this conversation was happening and said: “Be careful how you tell these dreams, look how Piedrola is in prison.” And I woke up after this…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
447,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'29. February 24, 1588. The twenty-fourth of February of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and asked me: “Do not you know that the Devil has been after Fray Martin of Our Virgin because he brought you the agnus?” And I said: “He will go to him until he succumbs to temptation; mind all the persuasions he used with you.” “But do not worry, because he is a strong wall, and the Demon will not defeat him, even though many times he shoots at him with harquebuses and other bigger bullets. And tell Martin of Our Virgin that whatever happens to you will happen to him.” After saying that, he took me away from my house and added: “Let’s hurry up! Our companions are waiting for us with great thirst! When we arrived at the seashore where they were, the Old Fisherman recommended: “You should better go away for a while!” I answered: “Where?” And he replied: “Wherever you would like!” Then the Lion Man called me and told me: “A few days ago I promised to show you those that will go with you, and now it is time for me to tell you.” Thinking what he was going to say, he added: “Tell Fray Luke that if he could remember what I said to him, he would not be calling John Lopez or any other people, because it serves better to pray than to hold weapons in self-defense. And also tell him that, while he is in Toledo, without going to the wolf, he should organize his papers to give to the dogs, that they will come to your words with this bait. And listen! You will win so much fame then that they are going to want to take you in a procession; and both of you will not want that because it is not the right time. And look at the sky to see what is coming down!” And I saw that from the south an angel was descending with his sleeves rolled up on his arms and with naked legs, but his waist was covered, and there was a burning ax coming out of his chest. In his mouth he had an unsheathed sword, and a bow in his hands with many arrows on his back. And I saw that he had a dragon rolled up in his legs; and this angel placed himself on top of a very high hill, which also came down from the sky with him and settled over the land. And when he was settled, he said to the Lion Man: “Speak up!” He started to shout loudly: “I am the messenger of our Father, his son, and the Holy Spirit, and these three people have only one will; and Jesus sent me to punish the priests. And I would have done it before if his Mother, the Virgin Saint Mary, had not implored for them, (for the love of Saint Ildefonso, whose prayers made her come down from heaven to earth) and she has only gotten from his son that he save the city of Toledo alone, where the Virgin laid her sacred feet.” After the angel said that, I saw him, as infuriated as a person could be, starting to tense his bow, and shooting it. And he shot so many arrows and so quickly in the air that the sun was covered with them. And he released and spread the fire out of his breast and sent the dragon away unrolling it from under his legs. And I saw the Old Fisherman talking to this angel, saying: “Tell me, why are you judging the priests this way?” The angel, very infuriated, turning back to him, explained: “Cannot you see that your saintly body will be removed in five years? Take this scarf from my arm and take this sword (pointing to the one in his mouth).” The Old Fisherman did it and when he had the sword in his hand, he asked the angel: “What do I have to do with it?” The angel answered: “You have to hurt your priests.” And after he said that, the Old Fisherman threw away the sword in the air saying: “Do your work!” And then I saw that the angel explained why all this happened, he said: “I have shot arrows because those priests’ hearts have thrown arrows against the poor; I released the fire from my chest because they have been burning in sins of the flesh; I have sent the dragon because they have imitated it in the sin of gluttony.” Turning around to see the Old Fisherman again, he said: “And with the sword, they never followed your example.” After the angel said this, in a second, he disappeared leaving a lot of blood behind on the soil where the hill settled where he was standing up. Then the Lion Man said to me: “Wait! Now you will see the king’s angel coming down.” I raised my eyes again, and from the north, I saw an angel coming down from the same sky on top of a cloud of blood and fire that sat down on the earth. And I saw that there were many bad vermin, toads, snakes, lizards, serpents and other animals alike in the cloud. This angel’s face was a lion with the chest and hands of a man. He had the haunches of a bear and the feet of a goat. He said shouting: “I am God’s angel that, following the three’s will, comes here to punish Philip; and I will not only punish him alone but all his monarchy. And I am not here to do it with a spear or a sword (because his enemies will do that, will punish him in that way) but with God’s whip which hurts even more for the one who suffers it. And Philip will suffer it more, much more than any other in particular because he has punished just people without reason and without fairness; and he has always tried to favor the bad people (whose images I bring here); therefore, I come here to do this.” After he said that, the angel disappeared and the Old Fisherman said to me: “You will tell these things to whom I usually show many mysteries, and tell him that he should remember God’s words to Saint Peter about the sheep.” The Lyon Man called me and said: “Tell Don Alonso to look at this paper, it is very important.” And then I woke up, crying out loud because I felt a strong pain in my back that I had when I went to bed; and I was incapable of remembering anything that I started to think that I had dreamt nothing. And praying to God, sitting down on the bed, I lifted my hand to my forehead and rested my eyes closing them, and everything came back to my mind, as if I was seeing it all over again. I thanked God as much as I could…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
448,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'16. December 30, 1587. The thirtieth of December of this year the Ordinary man came to me and took me to the seashore as usual, and walking on the path I saw three decapitated heads. I recognized two of them as two traitors that I have seen in my other dreams. And the Ordinary Man ordered me to look carefully at the third one to identify his body. I saw he had big eyes with a black beard and a slightly high nose. The Ordinary Man said to me: “Look, this is a close friend to the king and it is good for you to know him.” And I said: “I do not know him.” He took me in front of the other two companions, and the Old Fisherman said to me: “Did you recognize the third head?” I said no and he asked me again: “Where do you think these three heads were?” “In Madrid,” I answered. He said: “No. They are in Toledo, and at the door there is a bush, and they will be prisoners when Madrid is returned.” And the Lion Man said to the Old Fisherman: “Is that going to happen after Philip’s death?” And he agreed, although there was some disagreement and meanwhile I saw that many crows were coming together from England. And the Old Fisherman asked the Lion Man: “Where are they going?” The other said: “They go to Spain; and if you do not believe me, then come with me!” We all went with him and we saw many cultivated fields around the palace; and these crows sat on them and ate all the seeds. And when the crows flew away from the fields, many mallows and wild plants grew up. And the Lion Man said: “Here you see the king! He thinks that he has his land full of good seeds and it is full of weeds.” Having said that, he said goodbye to the Ordinary Man and the Old Fisherman, and keeping me company he took me to the palace and we found the king in bed […] and there was a lock coming out of his mouth, and from the king’s ear a metal ring was coming out […], and he took the lock from the mouth of […] and put it in the metal ring and locked it up with the key and placed it into his chest, and without making any noise, he left. I asked the Lion Man: “What does all this mean?” He said: “If Don Alonso does not understand it, I will tell you about it.” He took me to another room further away and I saw the princess knitting with a brown dog by her side that was barking a lot. And I heard her say (almost in anger): “Beaumont assured me that I will always have a dog; and you know who he is.” And he took me down to the kitchens and saw some man starting a fire and others putting it out. And he drove me out of the palace and took me to Toledo, and we went to a house (I do not know which one) in which I found Fray Luke writing and I said to the Lion man: “Look, Fray Luke is here!” He got to see what he was writing and said: “I am glad that he is trying to write what he is going to say to the king.” And he took me to the seashore where we found the Old Fisherman who said to me: “Look back again between England and France.” And we saw a tree with many leaves, and there was a wind that was called “ice wind” by the men there with me and they said: “Ill-fated land where God sends you!” And I saw that this wind burned all these tree leaves and it did not have any fruits. And at this moment, I saw a dog with a black head and a white chest that was barking slowly, and there was so much heat coming from its breath towards the tree that it made the tree turn back green in some parts. The Old Fisherman told the Ordinary Man to take me where he had asked; and he took me to the castle where I had seen the dead kings’ bodies. I did not get in through the top as before but through the door, and coming in through the vault, I saw that all of them had their guts pulled out of their stomachs. And the first one had gold in his empty stomach; and another had silver, and another had incense, and another had myrrh, and another had precious balsam and liqueurs. And when I passed by king Peter’s body, I could not see what he had because there was such a bad smell coming from him; and I saw that the king, by his side, had a tree in his stomach, (and it looked like an almond tree). And the next one had a palm tree, and I heard a voice saying: “These are our glasses and everyone shows what he has in them.” Side by side to this king with a palm tree, I found the man that I have seen chained in another vision with his damask clothes and he told me: “… This is Piedrola and he is descendant of those kings that are entering this cave, and is very close to the king with a palm in his stomach and that king (at the back: a lie) was kind of a prophet.” And at that time I saw that the chained man showed his right hand with an emerald ring and said: “Here it is, Piedrola’s hand! This hand will help you to recognize me and, look how tight I am.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
449,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'25. February 10, 1588. The tenth of February of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and told me: “Go out if you want to see how they are burying all those dead people left in Spain.” And going towards Madrid, I saw such a big dragon with a huge body and stomach that he took all the street space where he was, which was in front of the door to my house. I do not know if his body was standing up or if he was lying down on the street. I could not see if his feet were holding him up. I saw that his body was very black and full of scales, with no wings; his head, the size of a ram, had horns similar to those of a deer, each ending in seven antler points, and very black eyes; his tongue, sticking out of his mouth, was extremely long and very red; his neck was at least two meters long, and he was blowing very black smoke through his mouth as if it was coming from a big fire with no flames. He had his head towards the west and his tail towards the east; it was so long that he had it rolled around many times. I thought the tip of his tail could reach the sky. I saw this dragon walking on the streets of Madrid, crawling, and with his horns he was lifting and throwing back all the corpses that filled the streets and those people that were on the streets. I saw that some of these corpses were on his body, entangled in his body shell, and he pushed them away with his own tail and put them in piles. And those that did not crash into his body disappeared high in the sky with a bright light. In this way, with this plan, it happened as in the bread mills, that the wheat chaff is thus separated to one side and the grain to the other. This is how I saw it or how I understood it. Once he had a pile with those that he pushed with its tail, he crawled on top of the pile, (almost as when a hen puts herself on top of her many eggs or chicks, she seems to get bigger to cover them all), in the same way this dragon spread all over them. And raising his head to the sky, waiving his tail, he roared as do bulls and lions; and after this howling, I saw that all those corpses underneath were sinking away, and finally there was a big pond of very black stinking water; and there were very ugly weeds on the shores of this pond, they were so nasty that you could not look at them. And he continued doing this in many parts of this city, and in all these ponds I heard cries and howls under the water, similar to those of frogs in the ponds. There were some Moors among these corpses, which, I saw, were not pulled away by the dragon’s tail; small demons, looking as they do in paintings, came for them and took them away, making them all disappear together. When this dragon was getting closer to the monastery of Merced, I saw that the saintly image of Our Virgin of Remedies was walking out of the church. I could not see who was carrying the image. I shouted: “Oh, they are taking away the Virgin!” I saw that the dragon (close to me and to the saintly image) buried its head in the sand, hiding all of it, when he saw the Virgin and heard my voice. The Ordinary Man by my side said: “The Virgin of Atocha and all the images of Saints and Christs of devotion in Madrid will appear in places and lands that now are under infidels.” And after he said it, this monastery sank down, disappearing, without any signs that there was a building there before. From here, he took me to the seashore where I found the Old Fisherman by himself and he said to me: “Do you know if Fray Luke has come?” I answered: “He told me that he is coming on Wednesday night.” Then he sighed and I told him: “Why do you sigh?” He replied: “Because of all the pending work you have ahead; nevertheless, be glad that, once these times are over, you will see that Spain will have the biggest relics that she has ever had since the world was created, almost as many as in Rome.” After this was said, the Lion Man approached us and told me: “Tell Don Alonso that I have been busy, and that we should not wait any longer. We need to start planting the wheat and get rid of incredulous people from our site (and he said this moving his arms apart as if he had pulled some ropes away). I understand that Don Guillen will be useful to us and you will like him. And tell Don Alonso to do what he was supposed to do when he came from Toledo, and then he can go back home. Ask him not to tell anyone anymore of what he has already said. And when you see him for the third time, which will be in March, I will tell you many things that he will like very much. And I do not ask him to go in order to make sure he puts all my papers in a safe place; since one day Esdras will be talked about many times by the people, and he fasted many times to write about all these things that are already written and, it seems, they have not paid attention to them. One day, Don Alonso will be more than what he already is!” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'19. January 8, 1588. The eighth of January of this year the Ordinary Man came to me with a bundle of cut stalks bound with straws of wheat, and he placed it on the bed where I was laying, and I said to him: “Show me what you have inside this bundle!” He answered: “I will show it to you outside on the street.” And when we went out to the street, he turned the bundle upside down with the stalks up and the straws down; and there in the hole between the stalks, there was Philip’s face with his orb and scepter. And he turned the bundle back to its original position and left it close to the palace. And he took me to the seashore where I found the Old Fisherman, who was fishing and putting the fish into three groups. And the Lion Man was there with him and told me: “You must be happy; you have heard that there is somebody else saying the same things about Spain that you are told, however, he sees through his mind while you can see it for real and touch it with your own hands because you have clear visions.” And I responded: “That man also said that he has seen the prophet sculpted in stone.” And the Lion man replied: “It is not a bad vision for a witty person to understand and know who will be the king.” The Old Man asked: “Who is that prophet?” The Lion Man responded: “He is Beaumont.” The Old Man said: “Do not mention his name now!” I replied: “How come?” The Old Man took me away to see him, and then I saw a galley with a cross coming towards Spain, and another one was leaving towards England, and these two galleys fought. The galley with the cross sunk down, and the Lion Man said: “Do not tell that I showed you any visions tonight; all of them were shown by the Old Companion.” And after he said that, both of them, these two companions, sat down together and spoke about those archbishop positions that the king had given away for bad reasons, such as the position for Quiroga, who did not deserve it at all, he only deserved to be a village priest as he was not educate. They spoke about the Marquis of Au\xf1on and about the Marquis of Santa Cruz’s military units, and how they look for their own interests and not for the interest of the government. And the Lion Man said: “If it were in my hands, I would have destroyed these people a long time ago for sure, as they are so harmful to the government.” And raising his eyes to the skies, he said: “Blessed be God, your king’s star is coming to an end! And tell Fray Luke that if he knows the stars or knows somebody that understands them, they should look into the king’s and the boy’s stars and how they are in the dark sky; in this way, they will know what is due for the son and for the father.” After saying this, the Old Man got up and took me by my hand and put me on the top of a hill, from which I could see all England; and there I saw an almond tree with green leaves and dry almonds. And I saw three women dressed with English clothing, beating the almond branches; and one of them violently hit a sapling and broke it, and the other two women told her off: “Why did you break that almond sapling? You have hit the best part of the princess.” He took me down from that hill and carried me to the castle where the monarchs were dead, and we found gravestones where there were corpses before. The Old Man asked me to count them, and I tried, however, I was not able to do it as one gravestone looked like three and the three of them looked like one, and therefore I could not count them. He took me to the last stone where, by its side, I found the man in chains that I have seen before in another vision; he was in his Damask clothing. And the Old Man said: “This is Piedrola and he comes from those monarchs that are in this cave, and he is very close to the king, the one from whose guts came a palm; and that king was gifted as a prophet.” Then Piedrola put out his right hand with an emerald ring and said: “Here you see Piedrola’s hand; you will recognize me thanks to this hand, and look how bound I am here but, one day, I will be free!” And he took me away from there and carried me to where the Lion Man was. The Lion Man said to me: “Be assured, if I went with you, I would reveal to you who these monarchs are so you know his descendants.” Then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
451,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'13. December 23, 1587. The twenty third of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and took me to the seashore as usual where I saw the Old Fisherman, who at other times is usually fishing, however, this time he was inside a big clay pot (which looked like an oil clay pot) because as soon as he got inside it, he started to pour oil out through his mouth; and he also had a holy chalice with a communion host in his hands. And I saw many angels picking up this oil and this Old Fisherman called one of the angels and said to him: “Take this host to the place where it was!” I asked: “Is that host consecrated? And the Ordinary Man answered me: “It is consecrated as it is when Fray Luke does it in his mass.” I saw two angels dressed as altar boys with wings who took the Old Fisherman out of the clay pot and dressed him up as the Pope and a gave him a bishopric with a cross on top also as the Pope’s. They sat him on a chair and put a book in his hands. I saw him in this way and asked him: “Why don’t you talk to me? Is it because you are representing the Pope?” “He answered me: “No, it is not that; it is because I am celebrating God’s name as we are close to his celebration day.” And then the Lion Man called me and said to me: “Come here, I will reveal to you the angel’s vision while the Old Fisherman finishes his business,” and said “The bush in the sea and the angel on top of it destroying it means that our king’s life is finishing soon; and it was quite revealing to see the bush in the sea to understand that it was Philip, nevertheless, the dead body was shown for you to understand better.” And when he finished saying this, the Old Fisherman ended his business and the angels took the bishopric, the cape and the clay pot full of oil away. The Old Fisherman asked me: “Who are you going to tell this vision that you have seen?” I answered him: “To the usual one.” He added: “Look, do not tell Don Alonso but Fray Luke!” and I explained: “I cannot tell Don Alonso as he is away in Toledo.” And then, I saw the Marquis of Santa Cruz’s very powerful army, going towards England, and in front of it, rising from the water there were four women on top of the sea. They were the four queens of Spain that I have seen in another dream as they were in the same clothes. I saw queen Mary, the English one, with a rope in her hands and around her neck, and the Old Fisherman asked her: “Why are you carrying that?” She responded: “You think I do not deserve it, right? I have to suffer all my sister’s sins because I could have fixed it before, however, I did not do it. Still I am not the one to blame; I tried to help but the king did not let me.” And the Lion Man said: “What good deeds has he done in his life?” And having said that, all four women disappeared. After this I saw three men coming from the sea from the east. The one in the middle was chained and the other two came side by side, dressed in black. They put the chained man in front of the Old Fisherman and then disappeared. The Old Fisherman spoke to the chained man in Latin and I did not understand what he said. At this moment, I saw two very fierce lions coming from the water, and they tore the chained man to pieces in front of the Old Fisherman; then the vision disappeared. Then I saw a rock, which was placed in front of the Old Fisherman and me, and it opened up, and I saw that there was a Franciscan friar with a white robe inside the rock. I saw him from behind. I also saw how highly revered and respected he was. And then the rock disappeared. The Old Fisherman asked the Ordinary Man to take me to Spain and he did so. I saw that in Madrid there were infinite numbers of Moors, looting houses; and they were torturing many Christians, most of them women, in different ways in that square that they called the Barley Square. They tortured young women differently from the other women; they were flogged and thrown to the bonfire, also suffering other torments. They cut the older women’s throats. While I was looking at it, the Ordinary Man pulled my arm and said to me: “This is the time that I told you about when there will be many Leocadias.” And I saw all these martyrs’ blood running down as a river entering the church of Saint Andrews and the Moors went to loot this church and found a priest in it who said to them: “Take everything you want from this church and do not touch Saint Isidore’s body.” And they said to him: “The first thing we will do will be to cut him into pieces.” And I saw them trying to open the arch where the saint was, however, they could not get close to him as his body released such a bright light that the Moors fainted and had to leave. The priest closed the church doors. From there we went to Toledo where I heard so many women and men’s voices that it seemed as if the world was going to collapse. And he took me to the Alcazar where I say Fray Luke writing over a desk and I asked him: “Fray Luke, have you seen what has happened in Madrid? You must have been sleeping. They have tortured many martyrs and their blood became a big river.” I explained to him everything else that happened and then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'9. December 16, 1587. The sixteenth of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and took me to the seashore where the two fishermen were, and I saw that the Lion Man was without his lion and was painting the tree (that he showed me the previous night) from the island with very vivid colors. And he told me: “Girl, why do you call me \x91fisherman’? I have never being fishing.” And I answered him: “I have seen you with your friend bringing the nets ashore; I thought you both were fishermen.” And he responded: “No, there was a time when I used to go fishing, however, I did not go for fish.” And after he finished saying that, from the same place where we were, I saw that the city with the tower (that I saw in my previous dream) was burning; and the fire was huge, it was not the fire from brick fireplaces; the fire had a black and thick smoke. And both were coming towards Spain. I guessed that the fire was coming from the gunpowder barrels that were buried in the mines (as I saw it in last night’s dream, although I did not smell gunpowder). And I asked the Lion man: “Who was burning there?” He said that it was not important to tell me now, some other time they will tell me. And we left the Old Fisherman and the Ordinary Man sitting down, while the Lion Man took me to the same island from the night before and while we were there, he said: “Has Don Alonso revealed to you the meaning of the tree from last night?” “Yes,” I nodded, referring to what he had told me about it. He answered that he did not have anything else to add; all was good. And I told him that they could not say that I spoke too much this time. He said: “No, that was fine.” After this conversation, looking at the island, I saw the trees as I remembered them from the previous night. I saw that all the trees with leaves were burned, although they were still standing, however, those born from the big tree, as his sons, were not. And I got scared and said: “how is it possible that only these ones are burned?” He answered that he would tell me. And then I saw that three trees, which look the same (I did not know whether they had fruits or whether they were born from the big tree), were watered by the creek bank which was running from the west, and were right in front of the big and principal tree, close to it as if they were looking at it. And agreeing in admiration, I nodded: “It is good to see that all of these trees share this king’s water!” (And I said that because Don Alonso had already shown me this vision; he had already told me that this big and beautiful tree meant a good king, whose virtues and example of good deeds were shared with his sons and subjects.) And after I said that, I heard a voice coming from among those three trees, although I saw no one, saying to me: “Do you think that having a good king is not enough?” The Lion Man that was close to me told me that he did not say that to me, somebody else did. And pulling me down a slope in the island, he took me to another part in the south, in the opposite direction from where we had come and he said: “I have been with you three nights and I will be with you longer if Fray Luke does not come; however, if he comes, I will show you nothing else.” I added: “So you are not going to show me anything else as Fray Luke is coming on Thursday, are you?” And while saying this, I saw that the earth where we were standing was white and dry; and down the slope we found king Philip dressed as a shepherd with seven sheep (and although I did not know whether they were sheep or ram, I thought so because of the thick wool, so I describe them as sheep; the man close to me said nothing about it, and that is why, I believe they were sheep). And I saw that the shepherd sat down between some blackberry bushes and there he laid down to rest, falling asleep over his left side, and with his right hand he was holding the crook. And while he was sleeping, I saw a foreign man coming from the same place where I had come from, which was from the direction of England; I knew he was foreign by his attire as I have seen others like him), with a low topped round hat, a long shirt and tight red breeches. He had his right sleeve rolled up and a knife in his right hand. He got closer to the sheep, took them by their ears and cut their throats, skinning them, taking away all the flesh. He went back to where he came from with this flesh, and from the very top of the slope, he threw the flesh away into the sea. And he filled the sheep skin with hay and put them up in such a way that they looked as if they were alive, which was scary to see. It looked to me as a new way to steal; and once all this harm and theft was done, he went back to where he came from. And the shepherd woke up and hit a sheep that was close to him with the crook so it would join the rest of the sheep, which were grazing where there was grass, and this one was in a place where there was no grass. And after he hit it with the crook, as it was full of hay, it fell down on the floor. When he saw this, the shepherd got up and looked at all the sheep, grabbing them by their heads and discovered that they were only skin. And he started to shout very loudly and with anger. And the Lion Man told me that hopefully the Ordinary Man would not fall asleep again and would come out of the blackberry bushes. And he brought me to the Royal Palace in Madrid and took me into a room with stained glass windows and I fell in front of the stables on top of the main door; and when I was placed there he said: “Look at this room, it is blank with nothing hanging from the white walls,” and I saw it as he said, and turning my eyes towards the window, I noticed a stick coming through it as the baton that mayors used to bring. It had something written on it with certain letters that I could not read. And this stick often bent itself everywhere as if somebody was shaking it, and while shaking, it made a lot of noise in the air, as if it were hurt and hit with a wicker stick. And the Lion Man said to me: “Read those letters written on the stick.” And when the stick turned around I saw that they said: “King Philip signed this.” When the Lion Man heard this, he said: “Oh, unfair justice, hopefully, the one that signed it will not be bad!” And it seemed to me that he was very anxious when he said this. And the stick went back to the same window it came through, disappearing. And the Lion Man took me to another room in the Palace where I saw a desk covered with a black cloth and on top of it there was a royal crown covered with a sheer black veil (as the one that usually covers the cross adored at monuments), and close to it there was a royal scepter covered with the same black veil. And on top of the same desk, there was a bell, similar to a small cowbell, with the clapper tied up to the yoke, tied up on the outside to the crown on top and he said to me: “Ring that bell!” I was going to do so, and as the clapper was tied up, it did not make any sound. The Lion Man said to me: “You can understand now that when he dies, the Escorial bells would not help him because they are not to serve God’s good deeds as they have been built with poor people’s sacrifice.” And after he said this, he took me away from that room and went back to where the Old Fisherman and the Ordinary Man had been. And the Old Fisherman asked the Lion Man what he had shown to me, and the Lion Man said: “I will not show it to her in any painting, as I am fond of everything finishing well.” After he said that, the Old Fisherman and the Lion Man stayed there where I had first met them, and the Ordinary Man brought me home and I woke up… '",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'36. March 19, 1588. This same day the nineteenth of March I went to bed for a siesta just after I had lunch. I dreamt that I was in the middle of a field on a very dark night. I saw many people lying on the ground, sleeping. In the middle of the crowd, there was a well. Some of them woke up and the moonlight was shining on them (although I could not see it) and they said to me: “Give us some water! This well has a rope and a bucket.” I started to pull out buckets of water and then I called them, whistling, as shepherds call their flock to come and drink. They got up and came to drink and all of them were dressed in black, and among them there was an old man who said to me: “You will wash these men’s ears with that water.” And after he said this, I did not see him again. I kneeled down with my right knee on the ground; I put my left arm through the buckle handle and put it over my left knee, without untying it from the rope. When the men arrived there to drink, I put my right hand in the water and washed their ears with it. In this manner, I was pulling out water, giving it to them and washing them all night. And after I arrived at the well, I saw a woman covered with a black cape; she was lying against a post where a small ladle for water has hanging. I could not see her well; she looked almost as a shadow. Then the old man from before appeared again and said to me: “You have been a great Rebecca! This will be the last bucket you pull out! With this one you will receive grace!” I started to pull the water bucket out, but after pulling and pulling, it was so heavy that my strength did not last. Not only could I not pull the rope itself, pressing it down with my foot to stop it while I switched hands, but also the bucket was sliding down again and again, almost pushing me down along with it. At last, I made such an effort that with great exertion I pulled the bucket out of the well. And when it was up, I saw that the water in it was clearer than before, although all of it had been very clear water. And on top of the bucket there was a small child, two years old or so, with a beautiful face, blond straight hair to his ears (with locks such as those that small boys and girls from the hills have when they come to sell their products at the court market). And this child was dressed with a white linen shirt open in the front and his hood sewn in black, the wrists of his shirt were wide so that you could see his arms; over his shirt he had a silk coat that was purple (as they call it), very short as it did not go past his shirt, which went down to his knees. And the sleeves of this clothing (that he had on) did not go past his elbows and were very tight, and this coat was open at the front like the shirt. And he had a round ball of medium size like a common ball or sweet lime, in his right hand. The ball was of a washed black color. On top of the ball there was a cross of similar proportions, and underneath, from its half, there were many small iron chains all tangled with each other, hanging there. And with this clothing and all the accessories he was bringing, he was standing up with a foot on one side of the bucket and the other foot on the other side. He had his two little hands holding both sides of his clothes and his shirt, opening them up on the front and with this gesture he seemed to welcome people to cover up with them; and his skin was so beautiful that it shined. And with the bucket in my hand, lifted from the floor in front of me, I said: “Baby, who is your father?” He answered: “I am the father!” And while he said this he stepped down from the bucket to the floor. And the old man, with his face covered, took the bucket from my hand, and I did not see him again. Around this time, the sun started to rise, and some of the men, lying down on the floor, started to become clear and some others were still dark. And the boy said to me: “Take me in your arms!” I added: “Listen, I am very tired, you are going to leave me exhausted with your heavy weight.” He said: “Come on! I was even heavier for Cristobal!” And feeling that he would be very happy if I lifted him in my arms, I bent down to grab him. I took him in my arms pressing him against my breast and he went up so much that his small belly was against my chin. And in this way he said to me: “I also bring a little girl with me. Take her, if you can because she is also very tired, although you will get tired as well so you would not be able to take her.” And while I was walking with this boy towards the east, leaving all the men behind, I turned my eyes to my left and I saw a little girl. She was five years old more or less with dark hair, black eyes and eyebrows and dressed in widow’s clothes, covered with a cape. She was grabbing my clothes on one side, and I thought she looked exhausted. I saw her in this way, and feeling sorry for her, I said: “Sweet heart, where would you like to go?” She said: “Take me to the high city!” The boy said: “There is a river where this girl says to go; look around to see where you need to cross it. I did not want to give you so much work, but she wants to go there.” I tried to cheer them up and said: “Grab me tight, do not get lost! I will take you there.” After I said this, I thought we had walked so much towards the east that we had arrived at the end of the world; we found a rock that seemed to be touching the sky on that side. The boy said: “We have to turn this way, that is what this girl wants.” So we turned to the left where he was pointing and we climbed very high hills and rocks, and on top of them, the boy said: “I do not have anything to eat.” And I wanted to feed him. I looked around to see if I could find something and I did not see anything, and while doing this, I saw that the boy gave me his hand and talked to me saying: “This fruit is grown in the very dry hills and there is no better soft fruit than this for hard work.” I saw that he had this fruit in his small hand, and he showed me that it was a ripe peach, and he ate it all. And then we arrived at a river and my boy said, looking at the girl close to the riverbank: “This girl has given you so much trouble; go and cross it! I will take you to the promised land!” I was getting into it and then I found myself with my boy and girl on the other side. And I was entering a city through a door on the east side, which I have used before some other times. My boy said: “You are in Toledo! And do not put me on the ground until you take me to a church that I will show you!” And walking up the streets, I passed Don Alonso’s house, and turning to the right, I arrived at a church with some steps at the front door and with columns decorated with chapters. And there I put my boy down on the highest step. And I saw that the girl, who had been grabbing me, moved to one side of the church door. She shook her skirt that was full of dust, with her face looking at the church. And the boy waited for her to do this. And when she joined him, she put her right hand on his head, and they went into the church together. And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

December 25, 1587. seashore as usual and told me: “I want you to see my friends and also how well they are celebrated today as it is God’s day.” And after he said that, we arrived at a table with very white and long tablecloths where they were sitting; over the table there was a fountain with clear running water. And I saw that the Old Fisherman washed his hands in this fountain first and then the Lion Man, and then the Ordinary Man. And the Old Fisherman sat in front with the Lion Man at his side and the Ordinary Man at his feet. And then the fountain vanished. And then somebody laid some tablecloths (I could not see who was doing it) and I heard a voice saying: “Look how clean this water is after these men washed their hands. And everyone sitting at this table should have to wash his hands in this fountain, and if the water is not clean he will not sit down.” And I saw a walking stick with a stone underneath close to the Old Fisherman; and a lion close to the Lion man (as he used to do); and the Ordinary Man received a pumpkin and a leather bag. And I heard a voice saying: “What do you think about these men’s symbols?” I answered: “I do not have the wisdom to guess.” I heard a voice saying: “The walking stick with the stone means that the Old Fisherman has been the first stone in the church and the stick means help for the prelates. The lion with the Lion Man does not mean that he will do everything; it is for you to understand that when the lion has a person in his hands, it is the end. And the leather bag and the pumpkin mean poverty; your companion that carries them lives in poverty. And after this, the Old Fisherman blessed them and broke bread into pieces, and at the same time, they put a small wicker basket with muscatel pears on the table and the Old Fisherman said: “Oh, my Lord, all the goods in this world are not enough; these are the king’s pears, who has to come and whose works will be not acceptable to God as his sins are abominable!” At this point, many poor people arrived and they received some of the bread on the table and they put the table away (I did not see who did it as before), and the Old Fisherman said to me: “Ask Fray Luke to put white tablecloths because today is a celebration day.” And they disappeared and I awoke...

455,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'18. January 5, 1588. The fifth of January of this year, the Ordinary Man came to me and took me to Constantinople, and there I saw how they were getting ready with many weapons. And the Great Turk ordered that all of them who had been paid arm themselves so he could see how many soldiers he had at his service; and they entered in his palace, walking in pairs and fully armed. And after I saw this, he took me away, heading towards England by the sea; and as I was coming by the sea, I noticed that the sea was opening in an arch-shape surrounding many lands, and we saw some of John Andrea Doria’s galleys sailing to Italy; and he looked very restless because they had just gone through a storm, and they were not well armed. And when we arrived in England, I saw that in the main port to enter the city, there were many people guarding that entrance, while many men were decorating it; and we went to the city where I saw that there were many more people than I had seen other times; and I saw that they were arming themselves with weapons, pikes and much artillery, and that they were carrying a lot of guns and gunpowder to the ships; and I saw that Drake was walking amongst his people, dressed in brown, in clothes trimmed with marten hair. And after we saw this, we went to the seashore where our two companions were. And the Lion Man asked me: “Have you told Fray Luke what you dreamt last night?” I said yes, and he asked me again: “Have you seen Drake?” And I answered: “Yes, I saw him, however, I had already heard him say that he was in his sea in his land.” He replied: “It has been fifteen days since he has met with his people to get ready.” And this Lion Man was holding a man’s head with a blind eye, a dark face with a not very dark beard, and a prominent nose in his painted hands. He asked me: “Do you know him?” I answered: “I have never seen him.” And he questioned me again: “Well, if you do not know this one, then you may not know who Grumita is.” And he, very disappointed, threw this man’s face away towards the sea. And the Old Man picked him up and said: “Let it be, Don Alonso and Fray Luke will know who he is with these details.” And being busy with this, I saw a coffin with three tall crosses coming, floating on the sea. Prince Charles was on the first cross, king Philip was on the second cross (which looked as a blade), and on the third one was his wife, queen Elizabeth, who seemed to have the cross falling down from her shoulders. And the Old Man asked me: “Do you know those people?” I answered: “Yes. Why are they coming in this way?” And the Old Man replied: “It is not good to give too many details about everything.” And the Lion Man said: “Well, God has brought this here in front of us to see it, God wants this to be explained.” [Three lines are crossed out] “That is why she is carrying the cross in that way.” And at that moment, the coffin top was lifted and I saw the Marquis of Au\xf1on, who had a lot of playing cards on top of his shirt on one side and, on the other, he had many written papers. And I asked: “Who is he?” They said: “He is the Marquis of Au\xf1on, who has written so many fake papers, so God allows him to rest in peace with them.” And then I saw that there was another gentleman, close to him, facing down, with a fleece where a name was engraved with an awl: Alba. And when I read it, I said to myself: “It is the Duke of Alba who is there.” The Old Man said: “It is not good that the important people who have reigned over republics in their times show their names.” The Lion Man said: “Indeed, it is right. If he had not done so much wrong in Flanders and France, Spain would be in peace, and there would be justice as it was expected, there would not be so many Lutherans as there are today.” And right then, the coffin disappeared, and then I saw a basket of hens coming on the sea, and I asked the Old Man: “What is the meaning of this basket of hens?” He said: “Well, if the Lion Man has brought you these visions, there must be something important to see.” And the basket stopped in front of us, and I saw that four of those hens had women’s faces; I recognized two of them and, if I saw some portraits of women, I believe I would recognize the others. And the rest of the hens had men’s faces; two of which I also recognized. And the Lion man said: [two lines crossed out]… and then I woke up.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
456,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'34. March 17, 1588. This same day the seventeenth of March, after I had dreamt what I mentioned before, I fell asleep again and dreamt that I was in the house of Peter de Robles, (the foreigner and the man that arranged lodging for the archers, who lives in my neighborhood), down the street. And there I found the lawyer Parra in his room, sitting down on a bench, and this man’s wife was also there in this room, lying down on a bed on her left side, with the front of her body covered with a rug from her breasts down and breastfeeding a baby with her left breast; her back was all naked flesh from her shoulders to her feet. And when she saw me she said: “We know all your things!” I asked her: “Who told you?” Her husband replied: “Don Guillen sent me a short letter that explained to me all your visions. He also sent me a sword and a helmet; he asked me to go with him to defend against our enemies.” I said: “How come? Why has that bad Christian Guillen done such a thing? Who brought the letter?” Parra answered and then I went closer to him, and very upset, I told him: “Who ordered it to be brought to you?” He answered that Don Guillen did. “Because he needed people.” And he called this man and I went closer to Rojas himself and said to him: “You are a man that knows a lot about modern times, and you also know a lot about women, so why did you never tell me anything about it or report it to someone?” And he stared at my arm, looking very anxious. My arm was naked and he wanted to cut it in half with a knife, asking for one. I said: “I just wanted to let you know with honesty that, although you cut it, I will not feel anything.” I turned around to talk to Rojas and said: “You are a man that continuously follows the stars, why have you not reported this year’s forthcomings to the king (being yourself his servant)?” He answered: “Because I wanted to live in peace. If I had reported some of these things, I would have been a traitor; because I know I have the most hard-working sign on earth, because they will find me guilty, as I am a descendant of the Borgona family, and because the king has done much wrong with those lands. So, it is good that you are the one to declare these things because they cannot find you guilty of planning anything. And look around! Look at all these weapons that the king ordered me to clean so that the men that are able may go to fight to defend themselves!” After he finished saying this, the woman in bed asked me to be quiet, making some finger signs. I understood that she did it so her husband would go with Parra (who was afraid of what I said and had gone out to the street). And her husband left. And forgetting about my anger, I saw my arm covered up. I went closer to the woman lying on the bed and told her: “Come here! Tell me why Don Guillen sent your husband the short letter!” She said: “Cover me up!” I covered her up with clothes and a blanket. Then she asked for food and they brought her two fried eggs with bread. “Do you know that in the short letter that Guillen sent my husband he asked him to hide all the king’s weapons that he had with him? So he did, with all the helmets clean.” After she said this, she ate the eggs’ yolks and gave me the whites and I ate them. And the woman said to me: “I want to go to the church of Victoria.” We went there and I saw that it was completely destroyed except for a small chapel with the tomb. And then, we saw my mother coming in and the woman that was with me stood up and told her: “Oh, madam, I am such a sinner!” My mother asked her: “What kind of sins? What is it?” She replied: “I have made a woman have a bad birth! Come with me and I will show you how I did it!” She took me to an orchard that is close to Leganitos and there we saw that she had put a cabbage over a fire of many human hairs, and with the heat, the cabbage started to open up on top of the fire, and she said: “The unknown woman’s hips are opening up in the same way!” And she called this woman’s name. Then I added: “How can you prevent it from happening?” She answered: “By pouring some water over the fire!” I went to the Leganitos fountain and brought a big jug full of water and poured it on the fire. I saw Don Alonso coming, riding fast on his mule, and I asked Martin, his servant: “Where is Don Alonso coming from?” He answered: “He is coming from the Discalced” and then I asked him: “Which way is Piedrola’s house?” He showed me the way, and leaving there my mother and the other woman… I found it full of weeds, very dense weeds but not very tall, and walking on them, I saw that they had become an orchard of vegetables. And I saw my mother coming with the other woman (who was dressed with a very white shirt and with a turban on her head, Turkish style). And while we were all in the orchard, we saw a man sitting down in a corner of the orchard surrounded by grass, and I heard that he had started to sing: “Do you want cherries? Do you want some?” He repeated this many times and I asked him: “Who are you? Are you my father?” He answered: “No, I am the orchard’s owner.” I asked him: “Where is the way out?” He said it was by passing above that water wheel. I said to my mother and the other woman: “Do not cross it until I make sure it is safe!” And then I put my foot on it and it crashed down, and I said: “There is some betrayal here!” The man said: “It seems the Demon is helping her because she knows so much! I would do much better if she were in my orchard.” I continued looking for an exit on the surrounding walls. I found a hidden door, covered with a layer of plaster on top, and I hit it hard with my foot. It fell down and there was a river behind it, with a very big field on its banks. I sat down, as I was very tired and said: “Drink, those that are thirsty! And thank God that he has taken us out of there to the open fields, freeing us from the betrayal and labor that other people wanted to impose on us!” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
457,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'7. December 9, 1587. The ninth of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me with a palm branch in his hand, and hanging from it there were many dates, which seemed to be growing out of it from the top to the bottom, one after another; and I asked him what kind of palm it was. He answered me that he would tell me: “Look at all the dates in it!” And while I was looking at them, he said: “All of these are dates, and they grow from this palm, and all of them have the same principle. Tell me which one is the best date?” I answered him that I did not know, they all looked big and good to me. And he asked me: “Do you know if some of these dates are rotten inside?” I answered him that I did not know that either. And he replied: “This palm is a king and all the kings that you have had in Castille descend from him; and none of them have behaved according to God’s will, with the exception of this little one here.” And looking at the dates, I saw one, which was the smallest of all, and I asked the Ordinary Man: “Who is it?” “I will take you where you can see who this date is.” And carrying me out of my house, he took me to a small courtyard in the palace, where I saw the king Philip, sitting on a chair close to a column, with his back facing east; and I also saw another king on another chair, close to the right hand side of Philips’s chair, with his back facing the king. And behind king Philip, there were two men writing letters. And the Ordinary Man said to me: “Look, there are traitors in Spain, you should know them.” I stared at them and recognized them: one was Marquis de Carpio, Diego de Cordoba’s oldest son, and the other one with a thin face, red hair and beard, blue eyes, with a Calatrava cross on his tunic (which I distinguish well, however, I do not know his name). And the Ordinary Man said: “Do you know the king that is sitting close to king Philip?” And looking at him, I realized that he had a palm with three dates in his hand. And I said: “This is the Catholic Monarch, Ferdinand, because I have seen him in other dreams with the queen Elizabeth, his wife, and they told me that it was him.” And taking me away, the Ordinary Man himself carried me to the castle where the previous night I saw the beautiful lady in bed, who was still in bed as before. And I saw that there were many well-dressed and prosperous men in front of her, laughing amongst themselves to go to bed with her. And I heard her saying: “None of you will sleep with me unless you can put your head through the hole in this piece of bread”; and she showed one that she had in her hand. And I could see that the hole was so small that it was impossible for anybody to put his head through it. And the Ordinary Man took me downstairs to the room where the previous night I saw a woman blowing on a fire, which was already lit. And I saw that a man, one of those discussing going to bed with the lady (who I thought was a young foreigner with a pale face), walked to the fireplace and put out the fire, throwing a jar of water on it, and said to the woman: “Your lady is not going to enjoy this fire.” And right then I remembered other visions that I have had when they told me that the fire represents life, and to put out a fire, especially with water, death. From there, the Ordinary Man took me downstairs to the vaulted basement where the dead people were in my previous dream, and I saw that all the tomb names started with the letter R. And among those graves there was a tomb name with the name of king Peter, which I was able to read. And this corpse had a lot of dry buckthorns at its feet and his grave clothes were as black as anascote fabric, with a red cross on it. I wanted to continue reading more names, however, the Ordinary Man did not let me and said: “We need to go to the seashore where the Old Fisherman is. And he took me there, where I found the Old Fisherman alone, who said to me: “Have you seen everything that has happened?” I nodded and he explained it to me. And he said: “You now know that those dates are your kings who descend from one; and that small date, which the man that was showing them to you told you about, is the king Ferdinand the Catholic, who you will not find among those corpses.” He continued: “Are you aware of the evil that has happened?” And I answered him: “Tell me.” And he asked: “The man that goes with you has told you about it, hasn’t he? He has to tell you first and then I have to confirm it.” And with that said, I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
458,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'22. January 26, 1588. The twenty-sixth of January of this year I dreamt that I heard a voice saying to me: “Look through the window!” I looked through it and saw blood on the floor everywhere, there was so much blood that it rose several feet high. Floating in that blood there were many dead bodies and among them I saw one alive all covered in blood and he said to me: “I am the son of that one from Cordoba. I am the one you saw as a traitor, and last May I received the first letter. They gave us our first gift of 15,000 ducados, which were divided amongst three of us. You need to know the other two people as you already know me.” And after he said that, the other two drifted away. Then I saw some men coming, beating a deer with a stick, and I said to them: “Why are you hurting it?” And they responded: “The king of these deer has done so much harm to us: he has taken our lands away and there are more bad women because of the poverty he has brought to us.” From the window I saw three men coming out of the city of Toledo. One was tall and the other two looked the same; the one in the middle had black Damask clothing pushed into his sleeve and I heard him saying: “I came in with this clothing and I go away with it.” And I saw these men beating this blood with sticks to stop it from entering Toledo. They continued doing this until they reached Madrid, where they pushed the blood away to fall into a creek. At that time, I saw many Moors coming with many loaded beasts and I asked them: “Where do you go?” And they answered they were going to Granada, where they could not be expelled, no matter how many enemies would come because the Great Turk was going to send them great help. After these people walked away, I saw many French and English people, and among them there was a crowned king… who had a cloudy eye or had a blind eye (I could not figure out which it was). And then the three men from Toledo arrived and they brought company and they fought these enemies and killed many of them and removed the crown from the one with it. And I saw that those who came with the one dressed with Damask clothing on his arm said: “Crown yourself because you have won that crown!” And he responded: “Shall I crown myself with such a crown full of blood?” And he broke it off into two pieces and threw it into the blood. And they returned to Toledo where there was quite a dissent because some people wanted this man with Damask clothing to be their king; and others wanted another one. And while arguing about this, I heard a voice saying: “I chose this one (pointing to the one with the Damask clothing) as your king.” And I saw many crowning him as the king but many others did not approve. And then three times I heard a voice saying the following: “Be aware that you will be condemned if you do not do it.” After this, many rebelled because one of Quiroga’s priests said: “It is not good that this one is king; he will not have a good government.” And after he said this, I saw a burning bush falling from the sky and it burned all of them. And then the one with the Damask clothing was raised up as king by all of them. And after this, I saw that all the merchants’ stands, closed before, opened up and the market was well stocked with supplies. I asked: “How is Christopher de Allende going to die?” The voice answered: “He will fight so much with the enemies that he will get killed. Tell him to walk on the roads, as his people will not leave him alone and they will guard him, and if he survives this phase, he will be all right.” And while I was listening, the Ordinary Man came to me and asked: “What have you seen?” I described what I saw as it has been told here and he explained: “I want to show you an astrological vision.” And I saw a star, symbol of the king, that was full open as a pomegranate, with many seeds as this fruit usually has. The Ordinary Man said: “If your senses cannot guess what it is, the Lion Man will tell you what it is.” And I saw a Moor dressed in green coming towards me and he asked me: “Are you not leaving? Listen! You need to get ready to leave!” And with this I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'23. January 30, 1588. The thirtieth of January of this year the Ordinary Man came to me bringing a mirror in his hand and I asked him: “Why do you bring this mirror?” He answered: “You are the mirror where all these people are reflected, as you warn them to win what they have lost. Look here! What kind of people do you see here in this mirror?” And I saw many armed people and I added: “How come? If I am the mirror, how can I see these people?” And he answered: “Do not you understand? Do you not see that they are going to see themselves through you?” I asked him: “Who are these people?” He answered: “Look here where they are coming from!” And I saw that there were up to 500 men coming from Sopena.” He continued: “Pay attention that these three men are going towards the front.” And I saw that they dropped their war mallets and I recognized Christopher de Allende and Fray Luke. In the middle, between these two, there was this shepherd called Michael whose expression made them shake with fear, and who did not carry any firearms, he was just dressed in his shepherd clothes with a sling in his hand. Then I saw that Fray Diego, John Lopez, and Trijueque revealed their faces. “Are these men very scared?” I said. “No, although being scared is man’s nature, they will do their deeds!” And looking at these people, I saw that they were organizing themselves in order, and after passing the river Tajo over a drawbridge, all of them were forming a squadron with Christopher and Trijueque as their leaders. They all walked towards the main entrance to Toledo and there they killed very many enemies. And turning to the second entrance of the city, they broke the siege surrounding the city and made their enemies run away; and many of them died and many tents were empty. Seven men of the shepherd’s troop were hurt from this battle, and Fray Luke called Navarro again to bless all of them. Navarro asked if those wounds were deep. Fray Luke responded: “Have a look yourself at them as you know better!” And then I heard a voice that said: “Bless one of the wounded enemies!” And he did so and the enemy recovered and asked to be baptized, and Fray Luke came back and baptized him and took him to Sopena to recover fully. Fray Luke thanked God because the church was back in place and they went to Sopena. With the noise, Ursula Beltran appeared outside, shouting angrily: “I am tired of taking care of the people inside and now you bring me foreigners!” Fray Luke replied: “This man is Christian.” And when Ursula Beltran heard that, she hugged him with lots of love. I saw Fray Luke going back to the Royal with his companion and when he arrived he said to the shepherd: “Toledo is free, I want to enter in the city.” Christopher advised him: “It is not a good idea until the siege is broken for good.” They did so and they went to fight at the third entrance to the city, where the siege was finally broken, causing many losses among the enemies. I saw that many men from the shepherd’s group were taking away the spoils of the battle from these people to Sopena. And I saw the shepherd, with his people, entering the walls of Toledo; and from a house close to the Inquisition building, they were shooting him with harquebuses, while he was laughing and throwing his sling killing many people. He did not miss a single shot. And I saw that in Toledo they raised up a man as king, which created many divisions among the community. And the news spread that the shepherd was in those lands, and the princess Elizabeth heard it, and as soon as she knew she ordered them to call him. She said to him: “What we need the most is to clean this land from those that do not follow God’s commands and to get rid of them.” And he went along the city, doing great damage. And I saw Fray Diego, who was close to Fray Luke, and I saw both of these friars carrying weapons covered with clothes like capes, and the spears were as thick as walking sticks. After I saw this, the Ordinary Man closed the mirror where he was showing me all this and said: “Some other night I will show you whether the shepherd won his victory.” And he directed me to the seashore where the two companions were and when we arrived the Old Fisherman called me: “Mirror!” And the Lion Man called me: “Star!” I asked them: “Why are you calling me these names?” They replied: “Do you not think that you deserve them? You will enlighten people with your words and will guide them along the path that was revealed to you, because you and the one that has given mass many times will see far away lands. When you are twenty seven years old and come back to find the one you thought lost, you will find it full of flowers and trees.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
460,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'6. December 8, 1587. The eighth of December of this year the Ordinary Man appeared in my dreams and said: “Would you like to come to that tall tower where I took you days before?” And I agreed. And he took me to a tower that had a leaf-type spire at the very top like the one from Santa Cruz; and he laid me on top of this spire, which opened up as if it were a pomegranate, and I was there sitting inside this opening. And the Ordinary Man left me there, sitting on top. Then I saw the chained and masked man coming closer to where I was, dressed in the same clothes as usual and he said to me: “Do not be afraid! He will come soon.” And I asked him: Who are you?” He answered: “You do not need to know, however, be aware I am from royal descent.” I asked him what was inside this castle and he told me that he would show it to me. And I saw how the floor where I was standing opened up and I fell down on a room, in which there was a fine bed, and I asked him what that bed was. And he answered me: “They used to call it a resting place in old times.” And looking at it, I saw that there was a beautiful woman laying down on it. And I asked the chained man again who she was. He explained to me that she was the owner of the castle. At that moment, the castle floor where we were standing opened up again and I found myself in a different room, in which I saw a common servant woman who was blowing on a fire, and she was so small and her breath so soft that she could not light the fire. And being here, the floor opened up and we found ourselves in another room below where I saw a common old man, sitting on a table, on which there were plenty of delicious foods, however, there was not any bread. And the chained man said to this man: “I want to show this young lady everything that there is in this castle.” And we went down to a vaulted basement in which I saw lots of tombs, everyone with named graves, and staring at them, I could not read them as they were in Latin, so they said. And among all these names I only could read a M. in a grave. After seeing this, the chained man took me up again to the top of the castle, where I was before. The Ordinary Man, who took me and left me there, had not come back yet so I sat down waiting as I did before. And sitting there and looking at the sky, I saw the Ordinary Man who was coming far away from the east and was bringing lots of beetles tied among them by their heads, and he went up to the top of the castle bringing them along. And pulling out his belt from his waist, he started to whip them up. I asked him: “Why are you whipping them?” He answered: “They will mistreat men, that is why I punish them.” And after he said that, all the beetles disappeared. And at that moment the spire of the castle closed in, as it was before. And while I was standing up on top of it, the Ordinary Man showed me many kingdoms, bringing them shrunken as small places in front of me. And they came walking towards me and they placed themselves in front of me on the east side where I was turning my face. And among them, he showed me the kingdom of Navarre, where I saw that some young Moorish men were invading the southern part of it, dressed in their traditional clothing and robes, and were burning the city with big torches, and I did not see anybody in it. And I saw Italy appearing in the same way, where there was a clever man, in his old years, dressed in black (and I think he was clever because the Ordinary Man said so). He was stretching a very old spear and he said: “There will come a time where I can use it against Spain.” I also saw Venice, which I thought was a really beautiful city with all its buildings in glass, shining in light. And I saw the one representing great power and contentment; and the Turkish sultan was sending them a messenger to ask for help in a war he was starting, and it agreed to do it, and as a proof of friendship, he sent him a big gift in a galley. And the Ordinary Man explained that it would be true that today, the eighth of December 1587, it sent him the present and the Turkish sultan received it. And then I saw the Polish kingdom in the same way, and half of its people were fond of their king Maximilian, whom I saw in his palace (as I was positioned higher above all the kingdoms), and the other half did not want him. And these latter ones were discussing and planning to betray him when the king went to church. And I thought I was done seeing all the kingdoms, when I asked the Ordinary man why Spain was missing. And in Spain, I saw that all men were dressed in brown and thrown over the stubble fields as I have seen them before. And as I was looking at them, I saw a peasant coming; he tied a ram to a grapevine and pulled it forward, leading it by a halter; and the ram tore up the grapevine by the roots, dragging it and leaving blood behind. And the man pulling the animal told the rest of the people: “You have seen that he went to take it close to England.” And after I heard that I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'26. February 12, 1588. The twelfth of February of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and took me to the seashore where the two companions were, and the Lion Man said to me: “What did Alonso tell you?” I answered him: “If you think it is a good idea that they should prepare some weapons for me to go and fight.” And he replied: “You will not need them, it is enough with that cross that you will wear.” Then the two companions disappeared, leaving me alone with the Ordinary Man, who took me to England, a place that I found in good spirits, as it was known that the Marquis of Santa Cruz was sick. At that moment, I saw that Drake received a letter from John Gonzalez de Taida in which it was warned that they had already chosen a general captain for the Armada and that if the Marquis was not boarding it, the English would win more easily. Also in Spain he had heard some predictions that England would be defeated in the second battle, so he would need to be careful with the arrival of the prince of Parma. And I saw that Drake received another letter from the Great Turk, which made him quite happy; and it said that his people had won some border entries into Poland, and that Maximilian was in big trouble. He had been advised several times in many letters that he and his people and his government, were there to serve him. And he had secret plans to gather soldiers for the month of July and they would invade Spain in the month of December and he asked him to keep the best soldiers safe. He got me out of there and took me again with the two companions, and the Lion Man told me: “Listen! In six complete years you will have your pope in prison because he wants to crown the prince of Parma king of Spain; and this prince knows very well that your king is going to die this year, and if he is going to fight, it is going to be for his own interest. He has certainly realized that while the king is alive, they need to give peace to the kingdoms to keep people calm because otherwise he would not be obeyed. And tell Don Alonso and Fray Luke to take this into account to prevent them from saying later on that they were not warned well in advance! He ordered the Ordinary Man to take me to Madrid and while we went there, he said: “In the year five, Fray Luke and Don Alonso will be in Toledo where they will live; meanwhile, none of you will live there until the new king comes, who will live between Toledo and Segovia.” He asked me to look towards Valencia and Seville, and watching closely I saw all the people trying to escape to Madrid, shouting; and behind those ones escaping, there was a big fire, so intense that the world was burning besides them. And before these people arrived in those regions close to Toledo and Madrid, I saw how all were decapitated. And he took me to Medina del Campo and to Antequera, and I saw that a big part of the Moors were already ready, waiting for the Great Turk’s soldiers for the month of July. He guided me towards the Sopena where I saw some men working on it. Then a Moor that was hunting around came close and had a look at the Sopena’s rock, and asked the busy men there who the owner was; they answered that the owner was Christopher de Allende. Then he walked around staring and looking up everywhere. The Ordinary Man said to me: “When there are three kings in Spain, the antichrist will come because in Philip’s time many vexations will have to end and there will be a new generation; because God is only going to recreate the world three times and this is the last one.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
462,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'33. March 17, 1588. The seventeenth of March of this year, when I was falling asleep, I saw a woman close to me. She had a very pale long face, (however, she did not look sick), a curvy nose, big eyes and full dark brown eyebrows. She was dressed in a very white nun’s habit with a black veil on her head. She came very close to me and took my face between her hands, squeezing it strongly. And as it hurt me, I said to her: “Madam, take away your hands because I am feeling sick; those nails of the cross that you have in your hands are hurting me.” She replied: “I came here to torment the flesh to cleanse the spirit. I am the nun from Portugal, you will know me from now on.” At this moment, I must have moved my face (as I did not like what she was doing to me) and she saw it and said: “Why are you moving?” I moved my hand up and down with disdain and told her: “Because I am not fond of Portuguese people.” Then I looked at her thoroughly and I saw that she calmed down and that she was covered with a dark reddish wool cape like those that the friars from the Saint Trinity order wear. I asked her: “Why are you wearing this cape if you do not belong to that order?” She answered: “Because there are Portuguese people.” And when she said it, she raised the wimple worn under her chin; I saw that she had her throat so tightened that no one could have it so tight, no matter how thin and small a person was. She said: “You do not have this!” (Pointing to her throat.) I denied it and then she said: “Neither does Martin although he is so close to God. I have it because I have spent a lot of time on my knees with many fasts.” I replied: “Madam, as you are saint, warn the king about these times!” She answered: “God gives each of us what we can take; he has given me this grace of having his sores and he has given you this other one. Use yours the best you can! I feel sorry for the evil that is coming; however, I cannot request more from him as I am not entitled to do so.” I said to her: “Oh! My head hurts!” She said: “It has been hurting me even more for three years now.” I asked her: “Madam, have you seen the Armada?” She did not answer. She put her hands together, intertwining her fingers and pressing them tightly together (as a very upset person). I saw that her sores were opening up more than before and were releasing tears of blood, some of them dropping down to my bed. And then she disappeared and I did not see her again. After that the Ordinary Man came to me and asked: “Do you want to come and see some good men of faith shooting arrows?” I nodded. He took me to the palace where I found his majesty sitting down on a big table, at which there were many people sitting and eating. I saw the king ordering a drink and one of his servants, joking with him, brought a silver jar full of wine and milk (I saw him pouring them into the jar). When he drank it, he started to talk a lot in a different language from ours, and as a crazy man with lost senses, he started to laugh and to fall asleep. And he was saying that he was going to name dukes and knights and archbishops and give some jobs and favors to whomever he wanted as much as he had power in his hands to do so. And when he was doing these things, I saw a man coming. He was medium size, dressed in black in ordinary attire and with his face covered, and carrying a loaded crossbow with an arrow. He shot many arrows at the king’s heart, but they did not hurt him and he did not feel any pain. This man saw that the king did not have any feelings, and he started to say: “What a heart, hard as a diamond!” And after he said that, the Ordinary Man got closer to him and took his crossbow from his hands and put it on his back, and the other man in black moved aside. And another three men arrived after him. They were dressed in the same habit (I did not look at them very long, only to see that their faces were covered as well and that they brought crossbows with arrows as the first man). They shot at the king and although they hurt him, he did not show any pain. And they started to tell him that his heart was hard as a stone, and other similar insults to express the king’s heart’s cruelty and brutality. The Ordinary Man, worried about this, said to me: “Take that crossbow and shoot some arrows yourself, let’s see what happens.” I shot at him and the first arrow vanished in the air without touching him. When the Ordinary Man saw this, he got upset and his face changed colors. He told me with surprise: “What is this? Are you hiding something from me?” Feeling very sorry, he asked me to shoot again and I did so. And I shot the king’s heart. I saw that he did not show any pain; water poured out of his heart. And the Ordinary Man said: “Now it is too late for you to have feelings!” After he said that he took me to the seashore where I found the two companions, and the Ordinary Man left me there and he went to talk to the Lion Man and very sadly said to him: “What happened to this young woman that has been hidden from me?” He answered: “I will tell you, and do not panic! You already know that they want to keep secret what happened at the vicar’s and that they want to cover it up before it reaches Philip’s ears. And that was the meaning of the first arrow going astray.” That said, the Ordinary Man disappeared; and I did not see him any more that night. And the Lion Man said to me: “That man that said that the king has a heart hard as a diamond is the prophet. All the arrows he shot without causing him any pain means that he has spent a long time serving him for nothing; and he has been very busy because he followed God’s commands; and the fact that he gave you his crossbow for you to shoot the king means that because he is in prison it is now your turn to shoot. And the other men that shot the king are people that had shot some arrows in the name of God and their prayers, although the king was deaf to them because he was drunk. Therefore, he did not feel them, nor did they help him. And at that time he offered his state to those that did not deserve it; and those, men of no intellect or capacity to administer what was given to them, had done things in the same way as it was before with the one that gave it to them. And you will not hurt him any time soon; death will take him away from you all. And be sorry for him! There has never been a king that has provoked such a pity and has gotten nothing out of it!” And then I woke up… '",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
463,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'32. March 16, 1588. The sixteenth of March of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and said: “I warned you many days ago about what is going to happen to you; you can start counting the hours not the months. God bless you and protect you from the rising flames of the candles! They will take all of you out of your houses! I do not want to see you in trouble because you will be the one receiving a bigger punishment; I do not want to get cross with you because I will be deaf to those that have been deaf to my warnings; I do not want to see you one against the other without being able to help any of you, because when these days come there will be so many bulls entering in Madrid that you will not have a place to hide, these bulls will not be coming one by one but in herds. And then the matadors, if they do not have poles, will throw themselves to the bulls’ horns with their own bodies. Then the bridge in Toledo will be destroyed and the waters will rise to stop you.” After he said that, he took me away from my house, and walking along one of Madrid’s streets that I do not know, he said to me: “This street is so well built! When will the day be that it rises up because everything was built with Chris’s blood? And God’s angels will destroy many monasteries where his body has been celebrated because they were not built according to God’s will!” Then, after he said this, he took me to the palace where I found the king very stressed because of the recent news: a few ships from the Army were lost. At that moment, a gentleman dressed in a red army suit (I cannot remember which military order it was, however, he was dressed with a plain and short lace collar, was well built with a thin face and grey hair, as such he seemed a good Christian from his appearance!) said to the king: “Would your majesty like to hear a vision that Fray Luke has told me?” And the king answered: “I do not like you; it would be better for me to call Fray Luke so that he himself reveals all the news to me.” At that moment the Ordinary Man said to me: “Let’s see Fray Luke’s face when he hears this!” So, we moved away to the back of the room and saw Fray Luke and his companion coming in and the king said to him: “Does your companion know about these things?” Fray Luke answered: “We are both in agreement regarding this confession.” And the king said: “That companion at the back of the room, go away! I am referring to him.” The king asked everybody to leave the room and said to Fray Luke: “You have done wrong in telling this to the Duke of Najera who is my enemy.” Fray Luke responded: “Your majesty, you do bad when you do not listen to the Holy Spirit’s good will, we know he is well intentioned, and he gives it to those that welcome it; and also when you try to cover it up here on earth at the expense of our honorable people. I know that your majesty is badly informed, and if your majesty wants to listen to me, I will tell you with only a few words.” The king said: “I called you to talk to you!” Fray Luke responded: “Your majesty, take a carriage and drive to Toledo and try to quiet your soul the best you can!” Then the king took Fray Luke’s hand, grasping it very tightly and he said: “What do you think of me?” Fray Luke responded: “Your majesty, your faith is short and those that pretend to gain your favor have transformed you into a lion. And if your majesty wants some proof, I will show you some documents.” The king added: “And how can we believe in those documents?” Fray Luke replied: “Because there are many things that have already been proven, that the prophets have already revealed to us. And I swear by Saint Frances’s order that I feel very sorry for the lack of respect that your majesty has in the kingdom of Heaven, which has made me feel very sad many times. Since your majesty closed his ears to Piedrola, your title of king has been removed from Heaven.” And when he finished saying this, he grasped a bundle of papers from his sleeve and handed them to the king. And I saw that when the king started to unbundle them, a lot of blood was running from them. Fray Luke said: “Your majesty, with all due respect, I confirm that you are not worthy to read these things!” So Fray Luke took the papers away from the king’s hands and put them back where they were. And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'4. December 4, 1587. The fourth of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and, used to talking to me directly, he informally addressed me, calling me girl; and he reminded me of his promise and asked me how I was feeling. And I answered him that I was a little bit anxious, without any particular reason. And he told me that I should imagine what I should see, and he asked me to get dressed. And I got dressed, and he took me by the hand (as he usually does), and he took me flying to the east and placed me on top of a tower and told me: “You are now in the highest tower of the world and now, look around! You have plenty to see from here! And I saw all the planet with lots of rivers flowing everywhere, and while I was looking at it, he came down from the tower, and stood on the floor, and said: “Now you need to come down, find a way to come down.” And I responded to him that I did not know how, I would have to stay there and, as the sun was rising and facing the tower, the sun was burning my face, and soon my face would be black, and I would not feel like staying in this place. And he asked me to come down; he forced me to come down and prevented me from staying there. And I answered by saying that he was a strange man. And realizing that he did not want to come up to help me, I started to come down, grabbing the walls and the narrow battlements with my hands in an effort to slide down. And when I reached the middle of the tower, I saw how the tower wall disappeared from there on down, folding itself inside in such a way that there was an empty space from there to the floor, then I saw that there was nothing for me to grab on my way down. I said: “I am going to hurl myself down.” And after I said this, by my side, I saw a masked man with clothes of black damask print and irons on his feet, bound in chains. He took me by the hand and helped me down to the floor where the Ordinary Man was standing, and as I saw him laid in irons, I asked him: “Are you Piedrola?” And he did not answer my question, however, he said: “Be careful with whom you share your visions and dreams, because, look at me! And although I am in irons, I will help you out in any situation.” And the Ordinary Man said to this masked man: “Why did you come to help her so soon? You could have waited for her to be more scared.” And then I saw that this masked man in irons disappeared without saying a word. The Ordinary Man took my hand and carried me to the seashore where I saw two fishermen: one old, and the other young. And I saw the young one lying on his arm over a little slope close to the port where they were and asked: “How are you?” He answered me: “Do not ask me anything as you do not want to do what I say.” And the Old Fisherman replied: “Ah, I wish this friend of mine (pointing to the Young Fisherman) could tell you all he knows…!” And the Young Fisherman reacted saying: “It is enough with two men telling her.” And then I replied: “Is he afraid that I will go and tell Aguiar, as I have not met him before? What is happening?” And he said: “It is a question of understanding it or not understanding it.” And I asked him: “Explain to me what the cart drawn by the buffalos that I have seen these previous nights represents.” And, touching his beard with his hand, he described to me that the buffalos mean life, the cart death, and the bloody wheels represent all the fair and honest people that are now dead in the afterlife because your king killed them; and those shouting behind the cart are the king’s bad councilors, and after the king dies, there will come a fair judge who will make them follow the king, squeezing them together; crows and rooks are heretics and infidels who, once the king is dead, will come to take all his possessions away from him; and I will not reveal to you what the brown eagle next to them is, so it is not known how such an insignificant man would come to have such power. And these heretics and infidels have got to want to revenge the king’s death, abusing his corpse, and the Jeronimo monks (who are the pigeons) will come to defend him, preventing them from touching his corpse. And the lion and the castle on top of the cart are the king’s weapons, which the eagle will take away to give them to its people, just as a vendetta. And the crows, which are the heretics, will be so absorbed and enraged with the innocent pigeons’ blood and with stealing everything from El Escorial, that they will not pay attention to the weapons. And when he finished saying that, the Old Fisherman himself asked me: “Would you like to go to England?” And I responded to him that I would be happy to go there, but I needed to know who he was before departing. And he said: “Who did Don Alonso tell you were brothers and fishermen?” I replied to him James and Saint John. And then he kept asking: “Are there others that are brothers and fisherman?” I responded: Saint Andrew and Saint Peter. They laughed, repeating these last two names, and asked the Ordinary Man (who was there by my side) to take me off to England. And he did, he took me to Drake’s house and his own sitting room. He was dressed in a brilliant red damask coat lined in fur and was also writing on a silver plated desk. And the Ordinary Man asked me: “Would you like to hear what he writes? I am not sure whether this is possible, however, I will try.” At that very moment, I saw that a man entered the room. Drake offered him a chair and said: “I am writing to the sultan of Turkey.” And he read the letter in which he stated that he thought that the war in Poland was starting and then that the king of Spain was sending troops to help his nephew Maximilian; and if this was going to happen, he promised, he would send help, he would send troops there, well paid troops so they would fight better. And I saw that Drake was closing the letter, and I said to the gentleman: “If the sultan of Turkey wins Poland, we have Spain in our hands.” After we heard this, we left the room, and going downstairs, we came across this gentleman, dressed in common clothes (in my opinion) with waxed and spurred riding boots and a short blue cape. And the Ordinary Man asked me to look at this man’s face in order for me to describe him in case they inquired about his looks. I saw he was a tall man with a red beard, hair and face, with a big nose and blue eyes; he seemed to be in his forties. This gentleman asked a servant if Drake was at home; he answered that he was busy and asked who he was. “Grumite” he responded, “the accountant of the king of France.” Then, the Ordinary Man took me home and I awoke with great thirst and ordered some water and drank it…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The twelfth of January of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and I saw that he was bringing a cross in his hand; he carried the cross to the palace and placed it in a tower with a view, and I said to him: “Why are you placing the cross in this part?” He answered me: “Because his death is close.” And I saw a blood river, coming from the area of the stables; this river was surrounding the palace, flowing with serpents and snakes –that I have seen in other visions– and with lots of crows, squawking with their beaks in blood. And three men came out of this river and looted the place and cut many children’s and old people’s heads off. And when I saw this, it was so disruptive that I started to cry loud and the Ordinary man said to me: “Do not be sad, do not cry because these things that God does, he does them to teach us a life lesson, so you should not be in sorrow.” I said to him: “John has told me that many Moorish are going to rebel in Medina del Campo, and when the Armada leaves, they are going to make war.” He responded: “I do not know about that, the Lion Man knows better; however, I can tell you that if those people are going to revolt, they will do it after the king is dead because if they see that the enemies are in Navarra, they will join them. After all, they have already agreed in the letters between them.” After he said that, he took me to Toledo, where I saw all the people together, shouting, and many of them were dying of thirst. And in the city, he took me to the church Santa Iglesia and I saw that there was a fountain close to the site of Saint Leocadia’s tomb, and all of her grave was covered in blood, which was a sign that the city was going to win, that is what the Ordinary Man explained to me. Then he took me to Saint Eugene’s chapel where I saw this saint with his miter and with his face all blushed; I did not see him annoyed, quite the contrary he was reassuring the people in the city, who did not want to go into battle and were shouting, confused and desperate. And I saw a lot of spears suddenly appearing in Our Virgin of the Sacred Heart chapel, and the priests, after seeing this and what happened in Saint Eugene, wanted to go out to the battle, and many of them left. However, there were so many enemies that most of the priests died. After I saw this fight, the Ordinary Man took me to the Alcazar castle where I found Fray Luke dressed in a white tunic, and I saw that he was praying for help with grand lamentations at the bottom of a crucifix, imploring him to encourage the people who grieved with no hope. By my side, the Ordinary Man told me: “Go and tell Fray Luke not to mourn so much for those things that God does.” I did so and he replied: “I do not cry because of God’s wrath but because of the actions among his people. In Sacred Scriptures, it is commanded that we grieve for our neighbor’s suffering.” And the Ordinary Man grabbed me away and took me to the seashore where I found the two companions mourning and dressed in black, and I said to them: “Why are you so sad?” They answered: “Well, we have many reasons. You need to warn Fray Luke and Don Alonso to prevent those people in Quiroga’s town and those priests in Toledo from going into the battle.” The Ordinary Man said: “This is because everyone is trying to be like their masters and follow his lead; a bad person can ruin a group of people who are good around him. As it happens when a bad person gives a sermon, God does not allow that his blessed words are well received among the rest of the people.” And the two companions kept talking and they said to me: “When you see Don Alonso, tell him to arm Piedrola’s nephews to go into the second battle. We already have these things coming up soon. We used to see the path before, now we have it right here; it was foreseen by prophets and saints many years ago. And be glad that you will do well when the king is gone.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'10. December 17, 1587. The seventeenth of December of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and took me to the seashore where I found these two usual companions, and the Lion Man said to me: “I did not want to reveal to you anything, however, I have to do it because the previous dream was mine.” And the Old Fisherman and the Ordinary Man stayed there while the Lion Man took me by the hand and carried me away to the island from previous nights. While we were going up, he said: “What has Don Alonso told you about these trees that you have seen?” I told him everything that he had said about it, and he added: “Very good, he was right, nevertheless, I will tell you all about the burnt trees and those in front of them.” He continued: “This one (pointing to the big tree) is the next king to come. The burnt trees around it are the rich people that would want to be close to him (just as they are now close to your king); however, he would not allow it, he would rather destroy them and extol the virtue of the poor (who are those trees with fruits), and you can see well these three trees in front of the big tree (pointing to those that he had showed me the previous night). He asked me to tell Don Alonso that all these three trees come from the same trunk, and all are one, and the voice that I heard came from them; this voice was one that knows what it is saying. And while I wanted to go down where I saw the king as a shepherd, he said: “You do not need to go down, as Don Alonso already told you what it was, and he informed you well, he was right in describing the stick that you saw in the Palace and the crown and scepter, covered with the black veil, and the bell.” And after he said that, he took me back to where we had left the Old Fisherman and the Ordinary Man, and going back towards there (that is to say, England) I said to him: “Don Alonso asked me to tell you that, although he would do what you ordered him to, to reveal these visions as he understood them, he would rather have you reveal them to me because he noticed that you do it better than him as in this past dream; therefore, he wishes that you do so. Tell me now: What was burning in that fire in the city of England?” He said: “That fire and smoke you saw coming from it towards Spain means that a big evil will come to destroy it.” A lot of people will die in it. And placing himself in front of the Old Fisherman and the Ordinary Man, he said to them: “Take this woman with you as I have nothing else to do with her, and give me back my ink and paper.” And after they gave them to him, he started to paint all the dreams from previous nights with great skill and very bright colors. And the Old Fisherman asked the Ordinary Man to take me to England, where I saw plenty of big and medium-sized ships getting ready in the port. And when we went to the city we saw many new foreign people to whom Drake was paying money, and in order to do so he went home to get some money and we went after him. And we saw how he took part of a hidden treasure out of the wall; they showed me this treasure in another dream. And from there he took me to another room where I saw a woman, about 50 years old (in my opinion), and he said to me: “Look at her, she is Elizabeth, the queen of England. She was sitting in a low chair, and had a dead ram whose stomach was cut open in her lap, although its bowels and intestines were in place. She was scooping up the animal’s blood with both her hands and drinking it with great thirst. And next to her there was a beautiful lady, although she looked pale dressed in widow’s mourning clothes. The English queen was giving her blood to drink with her hands, and the woman refused to drink it. Suddenly, in anger, the queen drew a sword and slit the woman’s throat. And after she bled the ram with her hands, the queen sent it to Drake as it was, and he gave it to his soldiers to take it and cut the flesh and the skin into pieces among them to put it on their weapons to rudely mock our king. Then the Old Fisherman arrived and, when he saw us, asked the Ordinary Man what he had showed me and he told him everything as it was told. And talking about this, I heard this noise coming from many weapons and I asked what it was. And the Old Fisherman answered me that he would tell me some other night. And they kept each other company and the Ordinary Man brought me back to my house and I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'2. December 2, 1587. The second of December of this year, I had the same vision as the night before, there was also a man holding a sword in his hand on top of the two buffalos, with one foot on top of each, dressed with red clothing on top and blue on the bottom. And when the Ordinary Man saw him with me, he said “True Justice” (JUSTITIA). And I saw that all the carnivorous birds came closer to devour the dead eagle’s chest, placed on the castle, and its heart was open. And I said: “Why do those birds devour that eagle? And the Ordinary Man responded me: “All these birds are carnivorous, and as they see this eagle dead, they all come to devour it; and remember these words I have told you; and tell them to everyone and also tell me what you think about them.” And I answered him that I am not a woman of intelligence, and I do not know how to talk about these things. Nevertheless, he insisted on me answering him, and I said that if this eagle is the king, as you have already told me so, then I guess that once he dies, many infidels will come to take away the best he has. And without any reply, he looked at me and crossed himself, then he said: “My friend walks very fast because he has casted his nests of Saint Catiusina in the sea, and I want to go where he is.” And he left with these words, and then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
468,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'30. March 5, 1588. The fifth of March of this year the Ordinary Man and his two companions came to me. I saw that the Old Man was holding a white cape over the top of all of them, and I turned to look at the Ordinary Man, I said to him: “Bautista, listen! Martin of Our Virgin has told me to tell you that you should do what he asks you.” “Who has told you my name?” I did not answer him. I turned to the Lion Man and asked him: “How is it that these past nights I did not go to where you were?” He answered: “Those nights that you do not rest are the Ordinary Man’s nights, because if you were with us, our visions would be longer than his.” The Old Fisherman said: “We came here to bother you with words because this is the second time we have come to see you; we have come to help you as Piedrola does. And you should remember the words he said to you when you were descending the castle.” The Lion Man said: “Do not worry about that! She wants to ask me a few things.” Therefore I asked him: “What did you say to Don Guillen about me?” He replied: “I never waste my words in answering questions that are irrelevant and that have been already explained to you by the spirit of Don Guillen, and you only see and they only hear. I only come here to tell you that you should believe those things that the Ordinary Man has showed you as true, and that Don Alonso and Fray Luke should remember the jar that broke in my hands, and that those people from Aragon (although they do not show it) want to welcome all your enemies to take revenge on Philip.” I said to him: “They said to me that I am very sorry for all the corpses and blood.” He answered: “If you were not sorry about that, you would be dead.” The Ordinary Man said: “Do you remember when I came with a bundle of wheat stalks as the Old Fisherman asked me to do, putting Fray Luke in a difficult position to declare it? Be glad! Those wheat stalks are your enemies; while they are fresh you will have work to do, but later on they will be dry when the white fruit comes out. Do not be sorry for that one with the name of Cueva! Do not you remember when you saw that shrouded man in the tomb with his nose all eaten up? Philip’s desires will be eaten up.” After saying this, the Ordinary Man was quiet and the Old Fisherman said: “What have they said about my naked legs?” I answered him: “Sir, they have said nothing.” He replied: “Naked is my house. They have mentioned God so many times that God is happy that they are paying for his churches and because they are getting rid of the bad people among the good people.” Then the Lion Man came to me and with his hand in the air over my head, he started to talk to me in a language that I could not understand. And the Ordinary Man answered him in the same language. And this went on and on for a while. And when they finished, the Old Fisherman got close to me and started to talk with Latin words that I could understand (because I hear priests saying them in mass), with a hand in the air as the Ordinary Man. He spoke for a while and the Ordinary Man answered him in the same language. And when the Old Fisherman finished talking, he said to me: “Tell them that I bring it on my shoulders.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
469,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'28. February 20, 1588. The twentieth of February of this year, a man came to me in the same way as the Ordinary Man usually comes, however, he had his face covered with a black veil and placed himself close to one of the walls in my bedroom, right in front of where my bed is. There was nothing else in the room except a tiny shining light, which it seemed to me was coming through a whole in the bedroom ceiling, from the moonlight. And under this small shining light, in the dark, I saw this man mentioned above with his habit and clothing as I mentioned before, without distinguishing anything else but a man’s shape, being very close to the wall. I heard him calling me by my name three times, saying quickly: “Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia!” While he was calling me in this way, I was dreaming the following: I dreamt that I saw John Lopez with a police baton saying: “Let’s go to see a festivity in the village of Our Virgin of Peace.” And he insisted on me walking on a muddy street. I said to him: “I do not want to go through there because there are many streets in Madrid that are dry and can take us to the same place.” I was looking at him and I saw that he and a cousin of mine (there with him) went through a very muddy area in the middle of the street; although I saw my cousin jumping up out of it as soon as he put his feet in it, and he went into a house where the accountant Cuellar lives (all this was happening in the street called Barrionuevo). And I saw the same John Lopez going along the area of the street full of mud and I followed him on the dry part of the street, by the side. And walking down the street in this manner, before reaching the street Concepcion Jeronima, the same John Lopez made me enter into this house that I know is the Inquisition prison (as I have heard it in the court). There, I found three images of Our Virgin in the church. I saw that one of them had Saint Ildefonso by his right side and a woman prophet by his left (and I call her that way because I saw that she had a sign on her back saying prophet). Our Virgin had her arms around these two people’s shoulders (as if she was hugging them), and she had her shoulders and theirs covered with a white taffeta cape. And while I was praying to this image, John Lopez came in to ask me to finish. And at that moment, I saw that there was a woman in that church, at the back of it. A young man came into the church and threw away a hat with hanging grapes; and this woman called two old women, that were also there, and gave them some of these grapes. And these old women gave me two pieces of bread with two or three very ripe grapes on top of it. And I ate the bread and I do not remember eating the grapes. And then I left that church and found all the streets heavily adorned with Damask tapestries and other colorful decorations. At that time when I heard that man’s voice three times, I woke up and I was really awake and very alert after hearing somebody calling me that way. I thought it must be my guest’s wife, and I said: “Oh, my Lord, who is calling?” The man close to the wall (I saw he had his eyes open) responded: “I am the Ordinary Man”. After he said that, I closed my eyes and I softly fell asleep again. He kept talking to me; he said that because he was sorry for Fray Luke, he came to tell me not to give out more advice: “And when the priests call you and tell you that I am the Devil, do not reply back anything! Declare to them that it is he! Oh, I feel sorry for your youth! Why are you getting into trouble giving advice to anybody? I also want to warn Don Guillen so he does not show any papers; you need to work together, both of you, to be in tune with them. If I did not love you so much, I would not have warned you.” I answered him: “Why do you have that black veil covering your face? It quite worries me.” He answered: “You annoy me with all those signs of the cross that you make.” I replied: “How come the Ordinary Man never mentioned this before? Is it possible that if you were him, you would come now to tell me this news?” He answered: “I have always tricked you on this and now I want to reveal it to you, as I feel pity on you for your naivety.” While on this, it came to my mind the “Verbum Caro” and I started to pray it, and as soon as I did this, I saw the man walking back towards the bedroom door. I said to him: “If you were the Ordinary Man as you told me you were, you would not be scared of these words I say.” He replied: “I want to go because you do not thank me for the good advice I have given you; and if after I go, another man comes looking like me, do not believe him! It will be the Devil.” At that moment, I sighed heavily saying: “Oh, prophet, why do you not come to help me as you promised me when you helped me going down the tower?” That man added: “Why are you calling the prophet? Do you want him to show you his witchcraft tricks? You and him will go to the same place!” And after saying this, I saw the prophet coming in on a white horse, holding a spear on his shoulder with an iron stick, and a cross in his hand crying out loud: “Overcome this and you will deserve to receive a cross, weapons, and a horse.” Then, I heard the demon starting to shout out saying: “Prophet, do not reveal to her who I am! I cannot defeat you, so at least leave me to do my work and do not come to warn her!” And I saw that the prophet raised himself up on the stirrups, with the cross up high and said: “Go away Satan! I forewarn you in the name of God not to dare to come close to those that had a bad spirit saying that you will do much harm to all the friends that they have and that are against you.” The prophet continued: “I asked you in the name of God why did you scare away John Lopez and those pious women?” He answered without looking at him: “I will tell you so you can see my trickeries. Just after the money was handed to Christopher de Allende, I introduced him to greed, saying to him that he was alone by himself in this matter so he did not need to give that much money, that he needed to be careful because if this did not happen, he would be lost; and that he would have to work very hard until he could earn that much money with his profession. Using the same reasoning, I addressed the pious women, who are very empty glasses of strength. I showed them the loss of their daily bread for giving money away, and I told them that they would not have to go where they were told, as the others would not care about them; and that if they took them away to that place, it would be to make them work; and if they would report it, they would get their money back and nothing would happen. In this way, I made all three of them believe, convincing them, that it was to serve God.” After he finished, I heard the prophet saying to the Demon: “Do not tell me more! I do not want you to defame them!” The Demon left howling out loud and the prophet said to me: “Be brave and do not be like the others you have heard being described here.” I asked him: “Do you know if I will see the Ordinary Man tonight?” He replied: “You will not see him, and tell Don Alonso that he should not write the wrong words in those papers that he should give to the cardinal because it would be like throwing baits to these dogs, full of rabies to bite us.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
470,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'3. December 3, 1587. The third of December of this year, the Ordinary Man appeared and said to me: “Wake up, tonight you will have to see more things,” and looking out of the window in my house, I saw the sky had turned red as blood, and I asked him: “How is the sky like that?” He answered: “This means that your king will die in a year when there is a lunar eclipse lasting three nights, followed within fifteen days by the appearance of a bloody red comet with a white tail; as it disappears, your king will die.” And I asked him: “How come this could happen that way?” And he answered me: “Would you like me to give you a sign like Saint John the Baptist to the angel? Another night I will tell you what the red star represents.” And then, I saw coming the cart drawn by the buffalos from the previous nights, it stopped in front of my window, and the Ordinary Man, close to me, said: “Go, it is time to start the battle!” And at this moment, I saw flying north a big flock of crows and rooks, carnivorous birds, and behind them there was that eagle from last night that has taken away the biggest part of the world from the paws of the dead eagle on the castle; and laying on a roof top the eagle shouted and talked loudly: “Eat his heart out, and still I will not be satisfied!” And the crows and rooks rushed to eat its heart, exposed and open; and at that time, I saw coming from the west a big flock of white and colored pigeons, like the common ones, which prevented the crows and rooks from devouring the dead eagle’s breast and heart. At this time, the Ordinary Man raised his eyes to heaven and said: “Oh Lord, have mercy and make this cart drawn by buffalos leave before these crows eat this eagle because you have promised us to keep this.” And having said that, those buffalos drew the cart down the street towards west. And then the brown eagle over the roof, seeing that the cart was leaving without inflicting harm to the dead eagle on the tower, swooped down over the dead lion close to the tower and said: “I will take revenge by devouring flesh from the lion,” and picking big pieces of flesh, the eagle took this flesh to the crows and rooks, who rejected it with disdain and poked it with their beaks and said: “Do you not think that we have plenty of pigeons here to give ourselves?” And immediately a big battle started between the crows and the pigeons. And the crows ended up killing all the pigeons, while the eagle on the roof was watching. Once all the pigeons were dead, the eagle, the crows and the rooks disappeared, flying north from where they had come. And I asked the Ordinary Man that was there with me: “What is this? You promised to tell me, and tonight is the third night.” And he answered: “I cannot do so, as the Old Fisherman has to tell you, and he has not come tonight; it is not something we can discuss now, but I will let him know, as he promised to tell you.” And then he disappeared and I woke up when it was three o’clock in the morning and soon after I fell asleep again (which does not usually happen since I began having these dreams), and I heard a voice (it seemed to be the Old Fisherman’s voice) and he said: “I was coming to see you, however, because you are tired, I will not reveal the dream to you; tomorrow I will show you because we are indeed men that tell the truth.” And without seeing and hearing him any more, and not being able to respond to him, I woke up again…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
471,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'21. January 19, 1588. The nineteenth of January of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and said hello, then he added: “I wish all those emotions locked in my companions’ hearts would be revealed. Get up and look at all the commotion in town!” I got up and looked through the window, and I saw many Moors dressed with their typical clothing; they carried Moorish war drums and they did not have any spears but harquebuses instead. There were one thousand of them in the front of their army with three hundred more with loaded harquebuses behind them; and these ones passed their harquebuses to the ones in front to shoot, and others were carrying barrels of gunpowder. And all of this happened at night, and I heard they were saying: “We have taken the road to the court so people cannot go to Toledo.” And I saw that they killed our soldiers. While this was happening, the Ordinary Man, who walked away and was returning close to me, said: “Let’s go to the seashore”. He took me where the two companions were and when I saw the Old Fisherman I said to him: “Welcome! Why have you not come to tell me these things the last two nights?” He answered: “I am glad to find you. Do you not see that both Fray Luke and Don Alonso were not here and nobody else could write these things?” The Lion man said: “I would have been here if Don Alonso had been here; he has paid no attention to what I told him. I would have shown him very difficult events during those wasted days, although we have not wasted our time. I will show them to Fray Luke step by step so he can understand them.” The Old Fisherman asked me: “What did John say to you?” I answered him: “He asked me to tell you that it was time to go to Toledo.” He responded: “Tell him that I said that he should do everything that comes to his mind because he has a good adviser to wish him well.” And then I looked again to the Lion Man and found him with a book in his hand, and he told me: “Tell Fray Luke that he should consider all these things from the beginning, and since they saw me in the staging post, these enemies have been rebelling.” Then the Old Fisherman asked me: “Do you know how the king is feeling?” I answered: “I know well that he has been sick.” The Old Fisherman ordered the Ordinary Man to take me to palace and he did, and there I found his majesty lying down on his back in bed; he had a silver dish by his side to spit on. And I could see that the saw that the Ordinary Man was carrying around in a previous vision was at the king’s feet. And I saw that the princess, dressed with a white skirt, was also there close to the king, and she looked very thoughtful. They were alone, by themselves. And then the prince with a red cap came in to the same room and put his hand on one side of his body and said: “Ah, it hurts here!” The Ordinary Man who was there with me said: “If the pain were a little bit stronger, it would happen what Beaumont said.” And I saw that there was an artichoke at the head of the king’s bed, and many men came in the room carrying tax documents, and they were taking this artichoke’s leaves and cutting them into pieces, then they threw them away on the floor. And when there was only left the artichoke’s heart, then they removed the heart; and all this was done in such a silence that the king did not hear anything. After we saw this, the Ordinary Man took me away and walked me down to the palace courtyards, which were all full of grass, and there were many cattle grazing around and many birds. The Ordinary Man, raising his eyes to the sky, exclaimed: “Blessed be the one that feeds them; the lord used to take his donkey to a piece of empty land and used to give pasture to his cattle, and now they have sold everything. And, therefore, God has allowed that his palaces are now full of weeds.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,,,,,Female,ID: lucrecia_1:lucrecia details,08-09-2016,"'15. December 29, 1587. The twenty ninth of December of this year I dreamt that I was in the Palace of Madrid, and while I was writing the visions a lady from the same palace came in. She looked anxious about a dream she had dreamt. She asked me to explain it to her. She was good looking with green eyes, blond hair and a long face; she was quite attractive. The dream was this: she had seen her father and his property between the horns of a white ox. I told her that, some time ago, I had heard that the white oxen were the Moors. If this is the case, Spain will be lost, as I have mentioned before. Your father will be taken captive. Then the king, looking very tense, came in the room and asked the lady to leave; and the king told me: “I dreamed that I was in Madrid, surrounded by white oxen and all of them rushed into the palace.” And I said to him: “Your majesty, you need to get ready as this is a sign that Madrid will be taken soon by the Moors.” And the king, walking around the room, looking very thoughtful, joined me to look outside a window over the main door, and we saw that three eagles were coming from the south with a crown in their beaks; and with great reverence, they placed the crown over the tower facing the forests. The king said to me: “Explain this to me!” And I responded: “The eagles bring this crown for the next king to come, and the time is running fast because a year and a half has passed. Your majesty, you need to plan ahead and arrange your will!” He answered me: “So, if I were not told and I were to get lost, it would be you and Fray Luke to blame because you knew and you did not warn me and God has advised you to let me know. And God wanted badly a soul and did not want to lose mine under any circumstances.” After that, he left the room where I was to let Fray Luke come in, as he used to visit three times a day, and then I woke up. I fell asleep again and then the Ordinary Man took me to the seashore where the two usual companions were; and when the Lion Man saw me he ran away. I told him: “Do not go away! I bring you a message from Fray Luke.” And he said to me: “If sometimes I have listened to you it is because you are a messenger.” And I responded: “Fray Luke said that if this news is from God, he is willing to speak to the king. He is not afraid of anything and is not looking for any rewards from the king.” And he said: “Tell him to be careful with what I suggest; and if I ask him to leave his business or if I persuade you to do any good or bad against God’s wishes, he will no doubt anymore.” And raising his hands to the heavens, he said: “Blessed be the Lord, the time has come when they do not believe in your words and request more proof of who we are. Does he want a sign from us if we make him blind?” I answered: “Do not get scared because you have told us who you are and the Old Fisherman also said it. Do not worry! Due to the fact that this is revealed to a woman, they could understand it as a false superstition.” “Fray Luke has already explained that I am Peter and the Ordinary Man is Lazarus.” And I saw that these two friends stood up to argue, and the Lion Man opened a book where they could read Saint Augustine and said to the Old Fisherman: “You mentioned Saint Augustine, Fray Luke also quotes this saint; if Fray Luke and Don Alonso do not argue about these dreams, they will not discover the truth. There was no need to argue with my friend but I did it in order for them to do it as well.” And having said that, he grabbed me by my hand and took me uphill, and there he showed me a closed book. He opened it and said: “Tell Fray Luke to open a closed book with many pages that he has; he needs to open it to a page ending in seven, and there he will be able to see a chapter with many stories of prophets’ visions.” And then, he closed the book and I asked him: “Who was the Franciscan friar who was inside the rock?” He answered me: “He was the Pope, and if Philip is missing, he will have to get a Roman to reign.” Afterwards he showed me a mirror, in which you could see a very sad princess Elizabeth; at her feet she had three dead bodies with blood running down, and the blood was so black that it darkened her skirt. And he closed the mirror and showed me the whole world in a broken glass and said: “This world will not heal until a new king comes.” And he added: “Who did Fray Luke say that I am?” I replied: “Yesterday, he said you were Saint Luke.” He answered: “To thank him for his belief about me being such a great saint, I will be careful in dealing with his matters from now on.” And still being on top of the slope, he said: “I will warn Fray Luke when he must inform the king; and when you go and talk to him, you should not have sad faces or he will think that you are hypocrites.” And I responded: “I will not have a sad face because I do not want to be one of those you said, I’d rather be married.” He added: “Yes, in other times, prophets were married, and, therefore, the prophet will go out and will have.” And he was quiet without saying anything else, and took me downhill to where the Old Fisherman was, who said to me: “You will bring this good news to Fray Luke, and tell him that we all are at his service.” And then I woke up…'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I go into the house myself and find I can concentrate perfectly. Then a voice says: ""What you are doing is dangerous. Religion is not a tax to be paid so that you can rid yourself of the woman's image, for this image cannot be got rid of. Woe unto them who use religion as a substitute for another side of the soul's life; they are in error and will be accursed. Religion is no substitute; it is to be added to the other activities of the soul as the ultimate completion. Out of the fulness of life shall you bring forth your religion; only then shall you be blessed!""

They were standing on two legs with human faces. They were able to laugh and talk to each other. They were talking in English. I was kneeling down, hopeless, no power. They were saying, ""Let's show him."" It meant that they wanted to demonstrate on me that they were able to effect pain on me. As they were throwing, they could throw big stones like bricks in the air, landing on my back. I could feel the pain. When I screamed the demons would laugh in delight. They were very happy. Each demon did this. They were many of them, moving around and throwing rocks in the air. I was thinking, ""What can I do?"" I then realised I had Jesus Christ. I prayed, ""Lord, I know you are there!"" At that moment I was lifted up. I felt an electric shock come in. I was some few millimetres from the ground. I said to the demons, ""Now let me show you!"" I ran after them. They scattered in wild directions. I grabbed one of them by the neck and said, ""Now I'm going to take you to the Lord!"" Then I went up in air with him. We flew up. In the middle of the sky, before going further, as we were passing through some clouds, we met the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, ""Oh you have come. I was just about to come to you. It is good you have come."" Then I looked at him and I said to myself, ""Oh, so this is how Jesus Christ looks like."" He was white man with a cream white gown. I was very happy to see him. He had a beard. He didn't smile. He said, ""I brought this sword to you."" It was golden sword, glittering. ""Cut into pieces the demon."" The demon was struggling to come out of my hands. Then the Lord went. Then we remained two of us. I said, ""Now let me show you."" I let him go and cut demon into very small particles. It tried to run away but I cut him. I came down back to earth with my sword. I found myself right in church again with many people. I was preaching to them. I was wearing a blue suit. (Because of this deam I bought myself a blue suit). People were convicted because of my preaching. When they were convicted, something happened. I could feel they were all convicted. When I was about to make an alter call a pregnant woman shouted in Bemba. ""He is just cheating. He is lying!"" Eveyroine now gave her their attention. They all looked at her. Some were worried. Some were laughing. The whole church was disorganized, trying to find out who had spoken and what was going on. I got annoyed and I shouted in English to the woman, ""I know who is speaking in you. It's the devil. And I command the devil to come out of you now!!"" The woman screamed, then fell down like a rock. Then I noticed everyone was very surprised at what happened. I told some men to take her behind the church in the office. I went to the office and started casting out the demons from her. [Immedately I woke up and said, ""Oh, but Lord, I don't understand this."" So I prayed; then I went back to sleep.] Then I was given a chapter. I don't remember the chapter but it was in Proverbs.

Then one night I dreamed I was descending a hill with my family into the plain. The sun had just gone down. Then the heavens opened in the west and a red globe came towards me.

Without an effort to put a fight (which is my normal reaction in such circumstances), I started running along the river banks knowing a fight was at my odds. The men ran after me and the race for my life was on. I must have been running for an hour or two when I finally came to a bridge. The bridge was familiar. It was only a few kilometres to my mother's farm. By now I had outrun my enemies by hundreds of metres. I felt relief creep my body. My body was perspiring heavily and my clothes were soaked with sweat. I crossed the river and kept on running. Suddenly my enemies sprang from the bushes, it was an ambush! There must have been hundreds of them. They were all excited knowing their prey had no way of escape! I stopped in exasperation. I knew it was the end of me and out of despair I bowed my head as a sign of defeat and hopelessness. I lifted my head up and then I saw a fine rope come from heaven. I have never seen such a rope before. It was gold in colour and very smooth. When I touched or rather took hold of it, it felt very comfortable. It wasn't hurting like any fibre rope would do. As soon as I took hold of it, it liifted me up. I felt victory come up in my body. My enemies looked up in disbelief and I said words to them which I cannot recall but whatever they were they must have been praise to God and mockery to their shame.

I said to myself, ""No, these people cannot believe. They are only farmers and nothing else."" Then that man said, ""Okay, let me prove to you that these people can listen.""

They went somewhere in the bush. And there was a big rat, very big one, very different kind of creature with very sharp teeth. This person demonstrated. He said, ""Okay have you seen this rat? It's got sharp teeth. Look at this stick."" He put it in the mouth of that rat. Within a second that stick was cut into pieces. Then the man said, ""Have you seen what has happened?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""These women have tamed this rat. It is under control."" He showed me how they do it. One woman put her hand in mouth of rat and it did nothing.

It didn't bite me. So he took me back to where we were. Then he said, ""Even in the same way you can preach to these people."" He told me to start preaching. I had confidence so I started preaching to them. I had about five converts out of many people. That same man said, ""These five people are the ones who will teach their friends."" There was a division among the people. The five were saying, ""It's true what this man (preacher) is saying."" Some did not agree. I took those five and went away. As we were going we saw a sign that said, ""Slaughter House."" One of the five cried out, ""Look!"" There were rhinos, lions, snakes and other creatures charging from behind the house. Another of five said, ""We are dead!"" I cried, ""My God!"" And immediately we were all uplifted and placed in front of the road past the slaughter house. We went ahead and entered the church.

Somehow I had gone to get my results from my former class teacher. In the dream he wasn't very clear about what I got but one of the girls told me I had done very well. Somehow I found myself outside the class talking to some girls seated on a bench and one of them said I had passed very well and the other one said I had completely failed. I fouind myself walking toward the back entrance on my way home. Suddenly I stopped dead in my tracks. The class by the corner was busy singing a religious song but what amazed me was that they were all standing up with their hands pointing upwards facing the back windows. The song was about God coming soon. I was scared. Around me people started running. I panicked and ran toward the back entrance. Somehow someone had told me not to use that way but I didn't listen. What I saw when I got out made my blood run cold. Again I stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn't move nor run away. Loking up I saw this enormous spaceship facing me. It was a very dark brown with black edging. I looked at the class and they were now singing loudly that God had come. It landed. People really panicked and ran in all directions but the class kept singing. I found the strength to start running too for someone had come out catching people and converting them to what religion he belonged to. It really scared the hell out of me. I ran in all directions. But the same god who had come out continued the drill. He could see all - you couldn't even hide from him. This couple who were friends of his were working against him trying to help me. He finally caught up with me when I tried to jump this light brick wall by climbing a tree. He climbed hte tree and caught me. It turned out that their way of converting was by leaving their teeth mark. In other words, biting. The woman from the couple helping me happened to be there with her husband and she said she would bite me. She pretended to do it on my arm. That same god in the tree with me was not convinced. I can't remember if he bit me or not. He had been white and the couple were white too. The dream ended there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1875,,,,,Male,ID: african_church_dreams3:borny details,09-25-2015,"This dream I had in 1964, one time only. There was a revival in Choma. After the revival that night I really felt anything that can happen to my life I can go to heaven. One night after the revival I dreamt I was standing facing the east. It was in some kind of harvested field I was standing. I noticed someone coming towards me. As I was wondering who that man was, some kind of fog began to cover him. He was almost unseen. When I could no longer concentrate on looking at him I noticed he had already diverted and was moving away from me to go around me. He bypassed me and came behind me. Then he asked me a question [in Tonga], ""Would you like to see how heaven is like?"" Without looking at him I said, ""Yes."" He led me to a tall ladder which even reached in heaven. We climbed up that ladder. On the way I thought of how far up we climbed the ladder. The whole world had become dark. I feared looking down any more. As we climbed, at the end of the ladder, it leaned against a platform. This platform was vast. It was wide; the length on either side I could not see the end. At the end of the width there was a wall and a gate. The platform was built with a smooth brown, well-polished floor. The wall from a distance looked like a brick wall. If you came closer to it you'll say it is a wall, yes, but the plastering was like some person had torn a cloud and smeared the cloud over and around the wall. The gate was almost like these very expensive gates that you find at banks. As this same man opened the gate and went in, I followed him. Then he closed the gate and stood at the gate. Then I noticed we were now in a big room with someone seated in a chair behind a table with a big bench in front of him. I could not see him really but he was there. This big man behind the desk asked the other man, ""Why have you brought this one?"" He said, ""I just want to show him how heaven is like."" This man who brought me asked for a key from the man seated to open the door which was on the left side. The man drew out a bunch of keys, selected the right key, and handed it over. The man now went to open the door and called me over. Also stood by the door. I saw steps descending. At the end of steps another world had just begun. There were grass, trees, and many people. Some were singing, some were seated, some were walking. They all had a white robe covering feet and arms as well. Their movements were mysterious. When walking, there is no pain or hardship; they walked smoothly, perfectly, without any effort. Masses of people were in this world. They were moving in groups in different directions. The very man who brought me in said, ""You stick your head out and look toward the east."" Very high above there was a green sofa seat, very high in the sky, somebody was seated on it. He was looking at the people. This man said, ""It is the Lord."" After I was satisfied with the vision, this man closed the door and locked it, then he lopened the door from which we came through. I myself descended the steps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The terrible danger in which I had been in the night between the 29th and the 30th was afterwards represented to me in the sleep ; that I was upon a cake of ice which after a while could scarcely bear me ; further on I came to a fearful great abyss ; a person on the other side could not come to help me, and therefore I turned back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1914,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"101. This was a Sunday. Before I fell asleep I was in deep thoughts concerning the things on which I am engaged in writing. Then I was told : ""Hold your tongue, or I will beat you."" I then saw someone sitting on a block of ice, and T was frightened. I came as it were into a vision ; I held back the thoughts, and one of the usual tremors came over me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I came into a chamber below, where there were many persons, but I saw only a woman, dressed in black, not malicious ; she walked far into a chamber, but I did not wish to go with her, though with her hand she beckoned me towards the door. Afterwards I went out and found myself several times stopped by a spectre which covered me over the whole of the back ; finally it vanished. I came out, and then there came an ugly spectre who did the same ; it was an ugly old man ; at last I escaped from them. When I came out I saw many persons sitting in a gallery, and, lo, a mighty stream of water came pouring down through the roof, and it was so strong that it broke through everything in its way. There were some who tried to close the opening so that the water should not come in ; others who tried to get away so that it should not reach them ; others again tried to dissipate it into drops, and one who tried to divert it so that it would pass outside the gallery. Afterwards I came out thence, and in my thoughts I began as it were to measure and divide into parts that which proceeds from the centre to the circumference. It seemed to be heaven, for afterwards there appeared there a heavenly shining light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While driving into it the coachman cried to the other carriage to take care, as there was danger when he drove in ; I looked at the other carriage ; behind it there seemed to be a screen which was unfolded like an umbrella. I, together with the man who sat behind, took the screen, went in, and folded it together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1918,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"79. My past life was represented to me, and how afterwards I walked where there were precipices on all sides, and that I turned back. Then I came to a very lovely grove, planted everywhere with most beautiful fig trees in fine growth and order. On one of them there seemed to remain dried-up figs. The grove was surrounded with moats, except on the side where I was. I wanted to pass over a foot bridge, which was high, and with earth and grass on the top, but I dared not on account of the danger. At some distance from it I saw a large and quite beautiful palace with wings, where, it seemed to me, I desired to take lodgings in order to have the prospect of the grove and the moats always in view. A window was open far down in one of the wings, and I thought I should like to have my room there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1919,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"102. This was on Saturday night before Sunday. I beheld the gable-end of the most beautiful palace that anyone could see. and the midst of it was shining like the sun. I was told that it had been resolved in the society that I was to become a member, as it were an immortal, which no one had ever been before, unless he had died and lived [again] ; others said that there were several [in that state]. The thought occurred, whether it is not the most important to be with God, and thus to live. Afterwards somebody said that he would pay me a visit at 10 o'clock, but he did not know where I lived. I replied that, as it then seemed to me, I lived in the gable-end of that palace. Afterwards I was in company with women, but I was not willing to touch them, inasmuch as previously I have had to do with the holier ones. Many things then occurred to me, which I left to the good-pleasure of God.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1920,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"34. I then fell asleep, but about twelve, one, or two o'clock in the night there came over me a very powerful tremor from the head to the feet, accompanied with a booming sound as if many winds had clashed against one an- other. It was indescribable, and it shook me and prostrated me on my face. In the moment that I was prostrated I became wide awake, and I saw that I had been thrown down. I wondered what it meant, and I spoke as if I were awake, but still I found that the words were put into my mouth, and I said, ''Oh, Thou Almighty Jesus Christ, who of Thy great mercy deignest to come to so great a sinner, make me worthy of this grace !"" I kept my hands folded and I prayed, and then there came forth a hand which strongly pressed my hands.I then continued my prayer, saying, ""Thou hast promised to receive in grace all sinners ; Thou canst not otherwise than keep Thy words !"" In the same moment I was sitting at His bosom and beheld Him face to face. It was a countenance of a holy mien, and all was such that it cannot be expressed, and also smiling, so that I believe that His countenance was such also while He lived [in the world]. He spoke to me and asked if I had a bill of health, [om jag har sundhets pass.] I answered, ""Lord, Thou knowest better than I."" He said, ""Well, then do."" I awoke, with tremors. I then again came into such a state that in my thoughts I was neither sleeping nor awake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1921,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"61. It seemed to me as if I had gone astray in the dark, and had not gone out in company with others. I groped for the walls, and after a while I came to a beautiful house, where there were some people who wondered at my coming that way. They met me and said that this was not the way. I said that in the wind [ ?] perhaps there was an opening this way, which they denied. It signifies that this day I had gone astray the worst. Then there was a big dog that came in beneath the cover of the bed where I was lying, and he licked my neck. I was afraid he would bite me, but it did not happen, and it was said he would not bite me. Afterwards I was together with some comedians. Someone said that a Swede had arrived and wished to see me. We drove in, and a large staircase was made ready for him. It was a dog wrapt up, with a pup suckling. It signifies my terrible thoughts. Something similar was hanging from a fishing rod and could not be removed; finally in another room it was torn off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1922,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"31. I then fell into a sleep in which my whole temptation was represented to me : how Er[land] B[roman] sought by various means to get me on his side, so as to be of that party, (voluptuousness, riches, vanity), but he could not gain me over. I became still more obstinate against him because he showed contempt. Afterwards I was together with a crouching dark-grey snake, and it was B[roman's] dog. I struck at him many times with a club but tried in vain to hit him on the head ; he wanted to bite me but could not ; I seized him by the throat, and he could not bite me, nor was I able to do him much harm ; finally I got hold of him by the jaws and squeezed him hard, and also by the nose which I squeezed so that the venom burst forth. I said that while the dog did not belong to me, still, as he wanted to bite me, I had to chastise him. Thereupon it seemed someone said he had not gotten me to say one word to him, and then 1 quarreled with him. When I awoke, the words which I said were: Shut your mouth!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1923,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"84. I was conversing with Brita Behm who, as it seemed to me, had given birth to a son; yet, as Schwede had been dead for a long time, I wondered how this could be. The child died, however, and in its place were the two Rosenadlers. She took me into a large and costly carriage, of surpassing magnificence, and conducted me to Count Horn. A meal was being prepared there ; I went away but intended to return. I was flying evenly, but came to a fine looking town which I saw ; I noticed that I was flying in the wrong direction, and I turned back. I crossed a sheet of water on a foot bridge; there was a ship near by; I came to a hole. I then thought of bread, that large and small loaves were brought there every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1924,,,,,Male,ID: swedenborg_dreams:emanuel details,08-06-2015,"52. It seemed as if I was climbing up a ladder from a great deep ; others, women whom I knew, came after me. I stood still and purposely frightened them, and then went up. I came up against a green earth-wall and lay down; the others came after me. I greeted the women and they sat down beside me: one was young and the other a little older. I kissed the hands of both and did not know which one of them I should love. It was my thoughts and mental work [ouvrage d' esprit], of two kinds, which finally came up with me, and which I received again, and greeted, and took up again. Afterwards I came to a place where many male persons were assembled ; a great crowd of handsome young folks in one place in a flock; fresh numbers joined them, among others Henning Gyllenborg on horseback. I went to meet him, kissed him, and stood by him. Afterwards I returned home and was in my own house. I received many visitors. I knew that I had hidden away a pretty little woman and a boy and kept them hidden. There was moreover but a slight store of provisions, and I was not yet willing to bring out my silver plate before I should treat them; nor was I willing to lead the guests into an inner magnificent chamber which was well furnished within. It seemed that I was accusing someone, but I do not remember how; in the end, however, I crossed out and excused something, because he himself had said so, but the words were buried. [I heard] mentioned the words Nicolaiter, and Nicolaus Nicolai.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And there was a situation that I had to rent my land, but the other man couldn’t understand that I gave up the land because I had to retire early due to my illness. (It’s not an honor for the farmers if you rent your land. I have had a bad conscience when I had to give up farming, I had the feeling that I have to explain to everyone, the whole farming society, why I had given up my land. But it wasn’t my fault.) I wanted to explain this to him, as he didn’t understand me, and I wanted to tell him that he would have probably done the same thing if he were in my position. I was quite angry because he did not understand me, and then, he wanted to injure me. He had something in his hand, but I do not know what it was. It was so small that he could hold it in his hand. He was a real tough farmer and thought that I cannot just quit farming and give up my land. He told me his opinion and then he started to attack me. I was angry (intensity 4).

I often had this feeling that I’m not alone, that there is someone else with me, but I don’t know who the second person was. The weather was nice. The landscape was nice, too, I was on a viewing place. I had wanted to go there with J., my second daughter, because she hadn’t been with us the last time. (In reality, I’ve been on the mountain before, but none of us has ever been on the viewing place, because it’s only one year old.) I was worried because J. often feels left behind, and again, this was one of those situations when I wanted to go with her, because I had already been there with the others.

I had a nocturnal ejaculation. (This I haven’t had in a long time.) The blankets and sheets were wet, and even the mattress was wet throughout. Naturally, people noticed it, and then we talked about it. There were other people than you. We talked about relationships, and that nowadays it is not so easy to build up and keep up a relationship. First I felt it was very embarrassin to talk about it, then I actually liked talking about it. I felt older and experienced, probably because you are all so young in here. I felt that I was important and smart. There was a woman who was very attractive, she wasn’t anyone I know. I think there we altogether 4-5, all who work here. And I was giving advice, because one of them said that it is not easy to build up a relationship.

Then, on the other side, we had bicycles, and we had to drive to our homes. But there was some kind of a bridge to cross, it was bottle like, very narrow. There was a little fight over who was the first. I tried to get to the bridge first. There was a fight for the best position, who was to win. I was part of this fight. I suppose I was talking to my son, he was also there, also striving for the bridge, for the best position. He was not on my side, but not fighting against me, either. That was about it.

And I was still lying in bed and thought: “Do I have to go now?” They were two men, they waited for me, one of them was familiar to me, but I don’t know who it was. There was a house and an open square and there were two cars. The cars were dirty inside. And I did not want to go with them (in the dirty car). I was lying in the bed and thought: “Oh, come on.” It was, I think, a carnival party where I was supposed to go, because I had these colored bands in my hair. They were silly. I had dreamt before that we had been to a party, and that’s why I had these bands in my hair. But it wasn’t anything special. I thought we had got out of the bed, already, and suddenly I just saw myself lying across the bed, and I wasn’t in a mood to go with them. Now there were both men and women. There were also more cars. They were acquaintances, like the ones I would know from the parties. Two or three cars. And on the other side, other cars passed by. The people were friendly. Somebody was acquainted to us, he also came with us, acquaintances were with us and they told that two other persons will also come along with us. Like, you were making plans for a carnival party.

My cell phone had rang, before, when there still were lot of people on the bus. I took the phone out of my bag, and there was an alarm (reminder) on it. It was a nice dream, I felt content (4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to wash my hands but I couldn’t find a well anywhere. I started to lick my fingers clean, because they were so sticky and there was no water anywhere. But no matter how I licked, the fingers were still sticky and I couldn’t get the honey off them. I didn’t know what more I could do to get the honey off my fingers. I have no idea where the honey had come from, it was just there, in a clear glass jar. Like the ones they sell honey in. I think I was alone, but I’m not even sure if I was indoors or outdoors. I just kept thinking how to get rid of the honey, the sticky feeling was uncomfortable. But I wouldn’t get it off. It was all over my fingers. I can also remember a blue table cloth, but not whether it was on a table or in some other context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then you showed me a newspaper clip, and in the middle you were searching for some person’s wanted-add (wanted add like in westerns). But I don’t know why you did this or why this person was wanted. And then, I was the one in the picture, it was me. And I said: “That’s how I really look like.” The picture was fussy, not clear, and I started to read. And then I was awakened. I wanted to start to read and I asked: “What is this?” That I know. But I got no answer, and when began to read, I was woken up. The dream was just like now, when you really came in and woke me up. It happened in this room. I wondered why I was wanted, but I was really cool about it, because I had not done anything. There was also something about a car. The picture was about a car on its way.I also read in the paper that sometime in December this person in the picture was driving his car in Wörgl. I thought: “Was I really in Wörgl?” In the picture, there was a little river, and a church and houses. The church had an onion-shaped tower. I can imagine the picture. It was very realistic, like a photograph, although it was printed on a newspaper. And there was a river, it was somewhere in the middle of the region, Wörgl. There was some plastic in the river like it was a compost. The water was dirty, not nice, full of man-made stuff, like plastic.

There is a coastal inlet right there. Day after day I see this one big house. It’s under construction. I see a young woman outside. It’s a coastline like I’ve never seen; no street, subtle and hilly, short green grass, and these cliffs. The cliffs are extraordinary. The ocean water rushes in and splashes over and around these cliffs. The young woman is outside one day and I ask her about her house. Somehow she conveys to me that a tree had fallen in her room and now it’s being rebuilt. And when it’s done it will be stunning! I took this opportunity of talking to her to sneak further down and take a look at the water splashing into the inlet. It’s not very wide, and it’s narrow, just a little slit in the coastline. And when the water rushes in on the rocks it’s intense! I know these rocks are razor sharp and old. I know they are porous, perhaps volcanic and like glass, and like fossilized coral.

It is the job of a caretaker to take the stones apart and put them back together. I watch over the person who does this job, I offer support and I ultimately know how it goes back together. The lonely soldier has come to do this task and I will be there for him. I watch him take it apart, I call him lonely but it’s a metaphor. He has speed and subtlety, at times I see him as an entity in the water below. I am taken by his ability to move. I look upon his work with the stones with reverence. There is grace and benevolence with which he has replaced them, so much so that I can see no seams or cracks where two stones meet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And there has been either a friend of mine or someone that I am connected with that has lived in and protected a very old building. I don’t know much about this but I do know that as the fall of the town comes…..he’s let his guard down. And it doesn’t seem important anymore to protect the building and the grounds without showing the people if it’s appropriate, the absolute beauty of it. I went inside the building, it’s built of stone and it’s majestic. In the center is a turret made of glass and just outside it above is a windmill like feature; blades that spin around. Shaped more like a boat propeller. As it turns it faces down, faces into the glass. When you’re inside and look up you can see the blades and every time it turns it scoops up the earth. This is one of the aspects that is so beautiful, that you can see the dirt. And as it rotates slowly the earth falls off and tumbles down the glass. It’s really a wonder to see it. Outside the grounds around the building are covered in flat stones and in each one is a keystone; each flag stone has a circle in it. Like a core sample drilled out and then replaced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a forest of very tall wispy trees, a tall slender forest. I can smell the sulfur from the heat. It is hot. It’s not the trees it’s the environment. My lesson is to learn to survive here. I can escape the heat by becoming a creature or seeking refuge in a tree as if I can become a creature or a tree. I cannot see myself I only know I can change; I am a little girl and I walk into the tree but not into a separate place. Soon I am growing and the land becomes ice. It’s taboo. It is all frozen. There are tremendous mountains and these are my new path. I walk a great distance. It’s frozen to the core of all things. At last there is a cottage; a lone cottage on this white snowy mountainside deep within. I know that here waiting for me is a bowl of hot soup. I also know it is not the destiny I follow. I will stay outside. It isn’t that I feel stoic about denying myself this pleasure. Moreover I understand what is implied by NOT having it.

What I see is half of a cat; back legs and rear end. I can see the slice of the open area; flesh, circle of spine, not bleeding just pink. And there is a wire haired dog also injured. It turns out they belong at a house…I go there. The family sees me outside a sliding glass door. I point down at the animals and they let me in. Now we are in a boat, an Asian boat with a big hulled bottom. I know this family, and then it is implied that I have done something in the past that I shouldn’t have…..slept with somebody? Suddenly we are on a hill looking at the boat in the water. Someone else is taking care of it, piloting it. There is a way in which the boat separates; it closes together as if like a tackle box, it can collapse. It collapses in a heap, we can hear the sound way up on the hill. The man says, “Jesus!

But the boat seems to be getting smaller and smaller reduced eventually to a boat using oars. I am trying to get home. This home is a place I know from dreams. It is a home in the country beyond an apple orchard in a valley. I know every path along the edges, through other farms, and in between forests that get to this place. And in other dreams I have also seen the routes as if from an aerial view. I KNOW this place. Yet, I have misunderstood where I am and have traveled too far down river. I am way past where I need to be. I start to back track in the water, I can see the sternwheeler again and again as I trek upriver.

We were in the countryside and it was lovely! And there was a horse, a giant brown and white horse with 4 white feet, black mane and tail. Ashley is sitting cross legged on the ground. Suddenly the horse comes barreling over so fast and sudden. It isn’t likely that a horse will just plow into you so none of us really moved. It galloped towards us and jumped over Ashley on the ground and then ran around us. It was wild! Stunning and wild! Then I am having a conversation with the overweight couple. They were trying to get somewhere and they had a rabbit with them that I kept calling a cat. I tried to correct myself several times. They were trying to get somewhere and not having good luck. I was thinking, it’s too bad your luck is just getting worse and worse and worse. I wanted them to change that. Finally they decide they are going to hitchhike. But they were really overweight and had a rabbit! I said, “I think you should ditch the rabbit.” But she said she didn’t want to and the rabbit was trying to hide itself in her hair, they had a relationship. I was saying, “Well, you have a disadvantage AND you have a cat!” What I was trying to explain was that they were going to take up a lot of room in a car. Sometime later there are Turkeys on the hill. Ashley is really interested in them. I have a flash of blood in a pool but it’s not bad. I feel very happy to go with Ashley up the hill either to observe the turkeys or to hunt them I’m not sure. But they are beautiful dark spots against the bright green grass of the hill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I said, “I’m so proud of you for not burning yourself!” Then I hear the door open and realize Evan is coming in; I quickly pull out a five dollar bill and say, “Give me another.” I am talking to Kim and I am saying I wonder whether I should take Ashley to school or not. It’s dawning on me… My own daughter! Whether to take my own daughter to school. As I walk to the back of the coffee shop I see Evan is rolling a cigarette with salt, large chunks of sea salt, it was all over the counter and Kim is upset. She tells him to get out.

1980,,,,,Female,ID: magnolia1:magnolia details,02-20-2015,"“The bluebird” I am with a couple on vacation, a tour. We have done a lot of things but we don’t necessarily get along. We are in a little room, a kitchen, in Mexico. I have turned on the dishwasher, it’s small, plastic, and I can see its heart pumping. The kitchen is in a closed restaurant. Suddenly I hear a tapping on glass. When I look I see a tank of water, as if which to hold lobster but when I look inside I see a blue bird, a swallow. It’s trapped under water in the tank. In my mind’s eye I see it as tapping with a finger. I run over, open the door yet instead of the bird coming out a walrus/hippo comes out. I know right away it’s going to be a total pain to get it back in. It’s crawling across the floor with other companions. The bird is still trapped but it is conveying to me that it will be ready next time I open the door. It sees my hand coming and swims toward the door through the water like a dart and then wiggles in preparation and when I open the door it shoots out. I anticipate and wonder what it is like to fly underwater. The utilities in the kitchen are strange. We have already been many places and to other countries. There are many quaint and archaic systems for running water and getting soap. The toiletries cabinet is amazing; small wood boxes and secret compartments. I accidently spill urine out of a box in an old commode. The four of us had arrived at this place with relief as if we had escaped something. And there is still something not right, there is ownership or manipulation. Then I realize I’m late! I’m late to a competition in which my partner is reciting a poem. I hear him saying, “And the man………….” He had written an argument as to why something is one way. I felt bad for not being there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a seers place. It’s a big house, old, dark wood, quite empty. The seer will tell your future. I see that Rachel is there working with the seer and I feel regret because I should have been asking the seer for my own, yet, perhaps I did. I saw a rat with a very long tail slip through rocks inh the wall. There is a man there, who is not a welcome guest, yet I know myself to not have trouble with spatial relations; to be close to someone or to share with someone is not an issue. I wasn’t a fan of Rachel either but we shared a bed. Suddenly I’m washing a lot of makeup off my face, so much eye makeup, blue and green eye shadow and eyeliner globbed on. And there is a terrible wax in my mouth. The more I tried to get it out the more it was building up. I was scraping along my gum line with my finger. So much wax! Rinsing it with water just made it worse. As I reenter the room I recognize the man as a negative aspect to Rachel’s future. There is a lot of coming and going and a lot of unsettledness.

It had happened that I had put my mouth over the sink to blow or force it the other way but my mouth just filled up with shit. I was spitting and spitting it out. Rick Springfield is looking around and my eyes are following his, looking at what he is seeing; an empty floor and carpet drenched in shit. I was gagging and heaving, I threw up.

He’s very unusual looking; long narrow nose, in his 60’s, long straight gray hair pulled back in a pony tail. He’s wearing a brown wool Pendleton shirt tucked in, faded jeans. He’s got an instrument strapped around his shoulder; his face is pursed in the bright sun. He’s having a conversation with himself, so he’s being particularly expressive, but deep in thought. He’s laboring and I think he has labored actually. I also think it is known that he is mentally ill but he just has up times and down times. Nobody really knows where he’s going when he goes.

She wanted to stop in every small town and talk to every small business person. No one seemed to recognize her. She was an ordinary person; worried about her kids, worried about money, yet she was in no hurry to get home. We stopped in a neighborhood, hick and western. A young boy in a stunt dropped himself from 28ft. We started talking to people in the crowd. The more we talked and the more we told our story the more discombobulated things got.

They thought we were lying and that we had ulterior motives for being there. Then we are in a bar having a heated discussion about things when suddenly all of them drew their guns. “Why are we sittin’ here?!” they said. Angelina just started walking towards them. She had written a poem, “Cinder is a sleed”, and it meant the sleaziness of people. She walked towards them reciting the poem. She had guns but she wasn’t using them.

And somehow I had the notion that we had a fire alarm system in the house, and that Dad and I were sitting out in the back yard reading or something and they were in the kitchen helping Mom bake a pie. And somehow they knew they knew that she was going to burn something in the oven and that it was going to go off, so they came out of the house and they got in back of the truck, in the bed of the truck, and I was like, “What are you guys doing in here?” And they were like, “I don’t know; we don’t want to tell you.” And I kind of figured that it was probably going to go off so I climbed in the back with them, and there was just enough room for me to like lay down. And it was real greasy and kind of dirty back there. And Dad got in the cab of the truck and started it up and drove us away, and drove us around the block a few Dickes. And then I dreamt that somebody was getting married and we had to go see them get married, and that they were going to like walk down the street any minute with their stuff. And one other thing – I dreamt that I was looking through this book of biographies on techno singers, and I was looking for the girl who sings, “Come Into My Planet Soul.” I can’t sing at this hour of the morning! And I couldn’t find her, and then I think I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well anyway, I dreamt that we were at somebody’s house – I don’t know whose – they had a pool though. And in an effort to scare me, they put a bottle full of YooHoo, they made it in a plate with black ice and then they put a fork and knife behind it like the cross bone, and they put that out by the pool. And then all of a sudden we were at our house and Dad was laying on the floor sleeping, and I thought maybe he wasn’t breathing or something. And Mom was like, “Call 911!” And so I called and was talking to the dispatcher and I was doing okay until I came to the symptoms, and I just kind of froze and I passed the phone over to Mom. And we were laying in the bed in the dark, and by the time Mom was finished to them, while she was still on the phone, the guys arrived. And it was Lee Hanks, Mark Waters and some other guy we know. And then next thing I knew we were in the hospital and we found out there was nothing wrong; he was just sleeping. But I was all distraught over the fact that he was going to crab and complain as to why did I call when I didn’t need to. And the doctor who took time out of his schedule to check him out and see if there was anything wrong rigged a sound board in front of somebody’s yard, like a booby trap, knowing that I would go up to it and check it out. Well, he rigged it so it would go, “Whoop, whoop, whoop,” and so all kinds of sirens and “yoo hoo” and stuff when I went up to it, but somebody we know cut the wires so that didn’t happen, and I went up to it and I checked it out in this person’s front yard, and I turned it on and it started doing what it was supposed to do. And there was like this live concert that I was mixing in this person’s yard, as I faded into consciousness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last time I had a dream that Mrs. Dougherty was in Spanish class, and that she was going to teach us to sing “The Star Spangled Banner,” which was very appropriate. And Mrs. Dougherty comes over and sits besides me, and she said that she saw me in AP Spanish, which I really am not but in my dream I was, and that I should translate “The Star Spangled Banner” into Spanish while they were doing a staff writing sheet so that I could get some AP credit. And so I started in, and I can recall that I did it perfectly. I started with the first line, “Oh say, can you see, y puedes ver” (sp??) and I was having a little trouble fitting, “by the dawn’s early light, con la loof temprana de amanese (sp???)” into the melody. And I was really struggling with that. And later on there was something about Elizabeth driving the Mustang with somebody in it, but I don’t remember for sure what that was about. One other thing about this dream that I had, when I was translating “The Star Spangled Banner” and I could hear Whitney Houston singing it in my head, I started crying a little bit because I had such sympathy for my country and all, in my dream, of course. But I still had a tear in my eye when Mrs. Dougherty came over to talk to me again, and she thought that I was disappointed because everybody else got to hear it and I didn’t.

And we would sit there like we’re sitting on a bus, and then we’d get up and walk around and see all this stuff around. And Elizabeth was there and I was led back in this kitchen area with her and Mrs. Horne was there and she slipped down and she says, “Hide behind me. I’ll get in a lot of trouble.” And so I kind of like hide behind her because she’s so big, I can hide behind her. And they sit down and start eating this breakfast, like eggs and stuff.

Oh no, I think I got home from the park first.

I dreamt that in English we were reading in our literature book and we were reading this story about this man who was like obsessed. And he was obsessed with people knowing where they are and people feeling safe, but yet he did these things that really wouldn’t make them, or really wouldn’t make me feel any safer, like, for example, he wanted to put a little alarm thing that kind of sounded like back-up alarms near people’s houses so that they would always know where they are. Well, for me that would be just awful. And he wanted to wait until they were sleeping so they couldn’t say anything, and he needed a cool, breezy night to do it. And I think what he was going to do was tap into their plumbing pipes and stick it in lines and that when they turn on their water, the water would go through and activate it. And then he was also wanting to put them in elevators so that if people get stuck, they could make enough racket and be heard. Well, and then we finished the story, and we were starting to look at it and questions. Oh, and I walked out of English class with this girl named Marilla who I have, that sits next to me with my internship seminars. But here she was in my English class and I walked out with her. We were going down the stairs and there, set up on the landing of the stairwell, was a little sound booth, recording studio-like type thing. And Elizabeth and this boy sat down and they were listening to this tape of this band that was playing, and the monitors were facing us because there were microphones and they didn’t want them to fade. And I went over there and sometimes I have a bad habit of using – not necessarily a bad habit, but I have a habit of using two fingers to move faders instead of one, because when I want to move them in small increments I just two fingers. I went over there and I adjusted some of the faders and Elizabeth kind of was surprised at my two finger grip and she said, “Why don’t you just use one finger?” And I was like, “Because two fingers is more precise for me.” And about that time I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dreamt that we were all this party, and Dad and Mom and I were holding hands with a bunch of other people in their 40s, and we were all kind of marching around the trampoline and singing a variation of one of the songs that we normally wouldn’t even sing to. The real song goes, “Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!” And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, “Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done.” I can’t explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with Mom and we were like at Tyme Gardens or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn’t because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and Mom told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing Mom things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn’t go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn’t even like taking one. So then I was showing Mom the elevator, and she didn’t have a key, but she could put $5 in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody’s key is - oh, what’s the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, “I have never noticed that,” and she said, “That’s because you’re never sick.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And, you know, like they had relay races and stuff – well, this was kind of an odd type of a relay race thing that a family could do. What it was, was when there’s a lightning storm and the power goes out, some of the things that you can do to salvage things. And the first thing was you had to run all the way down to the end of the block and make sure that the transformer was still intact. Then you had to run back to your house and turn off your main circuit breaker in your panel box. Then you had to run inside and change your equipment to run on DC, and I don’t know where we would get that from. I didn’t remember anything about any kind of a generator, but I thought, “Oh, how neat!” Two other people did the going down the street and coming back to the house and all, and I would change, our sound system receiver had some kind of a switch to go from AC 110 to DC 12, and once it was in DC 12 mode, 12 volts, it would revert to this weird surround recording room that had a ____ and two surrounds and nothing else. And we were going to play a CD or something, or watch a movie, I don’t remember what. But I think I was going to do it out while the storm was brewing and banging outside, and I don’t remember exactly all the details; it’s kind of foggy now. But that’s what it was.

There was this one woman teacher who had maybe fifteen or twenty of us that she had to take around to a various number of classes and we had all our classes together. And we had six periods a day, just like in high school. And fifth and sixth period we could go to by ourselves, but first through fourth we had to follow behind her in a line and she would leave us with these teachers and then come and check back with us. I think that was kind of a development from the Wilcox Center. This one class was supposed to be – I can’t remember why – but in my dream I couldn’t really stand up right. I had weak muscles and I kept wanting to let my head just drop to in front of my chest, and I couldn’t hold my shoulders up straight. And the teacher dropped us off. We were in this big foyer, kind of like the Wilcox Center auditorium, and this professor was, I think it was Dr. Stephan from my college, and he was leading this chorus of people a little young than me singing, “_____________” and so on and I wanted to go and join with them, so I came to the front of the line and the front of the like block of people and I stood. And again, I was having trouble holding myself up straight, and that one teacher kept coming over to me and tipping my head up and like straightening my shoulders and I just could not hold them up straight. Then, as we were singing and breathing and learning the song, the floor became more bouncing and more trampoline-y and more like a mattress, and it got bouncier and bouncier, the more we did. It became kind of like a moon walk thing almost, but it still looked the same. And when I tried to stand the way you’re supposed to stand when your stand – feet next to each other, everything in alignment – I just could not stand; I would keep falling down. So I had to stand with one foot in front and one foot in back a little ways. Then I could sort of stay up for a little longer, but I would still fall down. And I don’t remember too much more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2308,,,,,,,,"(285) Last night I dreamt that we were at this Great Exploration exhibit or some kind of fair thing, but it was inside. And there were all these various things, and there was an area that said “Teachers,” but it should have been “Singers,” because they had a Sade display, they had a A______ display, they had a Celine Dion display and they had a bunch of other displays, and there were a few rides and a few little movie things going on. And I was there with Mom. Before they showed the exhibit – I can’t remember what it looked like, though – and we saw the Celine Dion exhibit – well, actually the Shaday exhibit was kind of elegant, kind of nice. The Celine Dion exhibit was kind of blah. It was set up on a table and it was a board, this round wooden board, and there was this real cheap, short, stout chinsy plastic figure of her holding a guitar. And there was this magnet and this magnet would move her around the board as the song My Heart Will Go On would play on this blah thing that was there. There was a whole other room that we hadn’t gotten to yet, but there was this red door that said, “Teacher’s Exit” and I had the notion that when you go out it, it would make an alarm sound. So it would go into like in a kitchen thing. Oh, I know, all of a sudden I had my CD writer there, and I am recording something, the machine freezes like it did for me yesterday. It keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then I realize that we started a fire. So we were running around now in the house, so we’re running around and we don’t know what to do, but the porch is like really long. Remember the teacher’s exit, I tell Mom, “Open the door and run out,” but she doesn’t. We just run out the back door to avoid all that, and I think she gets it under control before it really turns into anything major. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2309,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journala:jasmine details,03-16-2014,"(205) Last night I had kind of a whacky dream. I dreamt that we were going camping and we were in the car and we were going all around these different trails and stuff. And then Mom and Dad were going to get out and scout around for a little while, so they left the ignition on; and, I mean, they shut the engine but they left the radio on that is with the ignition. And so they went out scouting around. Well, for some reason the seat came out of the car and was like rolling along on the road, and it turned into like a swing, and I would be able to like fly along the road because of it. And Mom came by and said that at somebody’s campsite they had a sound booth, and they were going to play songs on the sound system pretty soon. And I heard a song played and Mom was going to take me over to see the sound booth, but I don’t know, something happened. And then Mom came into the room and kind of woke me up. And then I went back to sleep and had another dream, that, well, maybe this was like a continuation of that one, I don’t know. I was at Sunset Grill with my equipment, and instead of Suzy Barton being there, there were these three or four boys that were kind of rough. And I had the Peavey system set up and I had the CD writer set up. I was going to burn some CD’s. And I was up on the stage and in back of the stage there was this wall where I had a few shelves where I put some equipment. And the boys were on stage announcing and I was sitting back there with my, I was facing the wall, facing the equipment. And I turned on my microphone and it made feedback, and somehow I had the notion that it was because I had two CD writers – one was mine that I use and one was this white one. And I dreamt that this white one had faulty circuitry, and it was letting signals through that were causing feedback. Now how whacked out is that! Oh, and the plot thickens! So I gave that white CD writer to the boys, and in exchange they gave me this personal CD/ tape player and they gave me a Spice Girl’s tape . And so we got home and Dad and I are working on DP, and this personal CD tape player is kind of unique in that it’s like an interface with DP. That’s bizarre! Well, I guess not really; it was like, it wasn’t really too bizarre, I guess. And we were playing the Spice Girls tape and I wanted to put it on an audio CD, and we were running it through DP to kind of clean it up some. And then in the middle of that I faded into consciousness, like I drew a cross ______.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn’t have space to write them down and certainly couldn’t record them while I was over there. So I had a lot of interesting, fascinating, probably meaningful dreams that got lost. Okay, the first one: I dreamt that Mom and I wanted to take a walk, and we were going to bring the personal CD player along with the hand-held portable radio in order to listen to what the boats were doing out in the water. We were going to walk down to the waterfront. And we started walking and I got lost, and I just sat down and listened to the personal CD player. But when I was listening to it, the sound stung for some reason. And then we were riding around in somebody’s Fox 13 truck and it had a siren on it. And I had to stay like five feet away until they deactivated it. Another one that I had was that we were looking in Service Merchandise for a cell phone, and the cell phone that was supposed to be, it could, it was like a FM receiver or a hand-held thing. It really wasn’t a phone at all. It had three little knobs on it, it had a little display and an internal speaker. The sound was really thin and flat, though, but for some reason we were all fascinated by it. The next thing I know, we were walking In the park with this thing clipped to my belt. Well, I can’t remember any others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2313,,,,,Female,ID: jasmine_journala:jasmine details,03-16-2014,"(246) Last night I had this dream that I had to stay after school for, oh no, I was sitting in this room taking a test. It was kind of like math class, but it wasn’t. It was like some room I’ve never been in. And this fire alarm box in the back of the room had these like wires attached to it, and what you were supposed to do was attach the wires to some kind of big appliance, and if the big appliance gets too hot, it’ll go off. So everybody in the class gets this form to fill out about what they’ve done in the school year, and so I’ve ______, and so we’re all sitting there writing our papers and the room is so quiet, and this boy in the back of the room is sitting there fiddling with these wires. And Elizabeth and me are both telling him to stop, but he won’t. And then the class starts getting all more commotiony. And then for some reason the teacher switched off the lights and put them overhead, and was teaching us how to write 8’s so that they looked good – you know, how they used to teach us how to write letters in kindergarten? Well, this teacher was so upset with the way we’d been writing 8’s. She wanted to teach us how to write them right. And then the class cleared out and Mrs. Dougherty came by and said, “If you wait here fifteen minutes, I want to come back and practice with you.” Well, I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for it felt like two or three hours, and I went to this little room that had a bathroom. And I took my clothes off and left them in the bathroom, and I went to the bathroom. By the way, I really did have to do when I woke up. And it was getting dark outside and I thought that it was like way past the time when I was supposed to go home, so I was going to call Mom and Dad, but just as I was going to call, Mom came up to get me and said that she had been vacuuming the track and so it took her forever. That was crazy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2314,,,,,,,03-16-2014,"(292) Last night I had quite a dream. I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were coming for my graduation, and they were going to be here in like a few days. And I was in the house and I think Sam was already here, and we were going to turn on the air conditioner for him so he wouldn’t be hot. And this evangelist girl, kind of like a Spanish descent, real nice and real sweet, was in Mom’s work room talking to this black street kid who was like, the black kid was like this big momma, like Missy Elliot just sitting there, and she was so mean and so harsh that the evangelist girl was trying to convert her and make her softer, but it didn’t work. So they both ran out of the house, and then I remembered I was going to the Dome, and so I got there and I didn’t know whose equipment was going to be set up or when, and I went up the stairs, and, of course, Dad was like following me the whole time. For some reason the gates were locked and we had to get somebody to open them up and let us in. And we went up the stairs and, to my relief, the guys were there setting up their equipment, and I had my cane for whatever reason, and I actually like bumped into a pole. So they set up the equipment – the board and the CD players – and they connected one of the CD players by way of RCA connectors, but they left the other one undone for who knows what reason. And I was trying to connect it, but for some reason I had the notion that the RCA connectors would carry all the power from like the power mixer. And so Dad was like, “You don’t have to turn the power off,” but I didn’t want to touch the actual receptacle. It was like I was trying to connect the speaker jacks while the unit was on, but it wasn’t; it was just the line level, but I thought that it wasn’t, so I was real, real cautious. And the RCA jacks weren’t these like regular RCA’s. They were like flat things that you have to slide into p_____. It was weird, and soon after I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2317,,,,,,,,"(190) Last night I had kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that we were at Fort Washington and Mom was saying last time we were here we had a big fight. And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Carl and Arlene in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that’s probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Carl and Arlene home. I ran in and we had this porch that wasn’t screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Carl and Arlene were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they wouldn’t see them. And I don’t remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Carl and Arlene were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Carl and Arlene. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on. I don’t know how meaningful that is, but it certainly is interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2318,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journala:jasmine details,03-16-2014,"(223) Last night I had kind of a crazy dream that was a conglomeration of several things. I dreamt that I was swimming through this pool carrying this replica of King Triton’s trident, imagining and believing that I was going to take it back to his castle or something, or take it from him and give it to Ariel, or something like that. But I was like part of the story and we were acting it out in this swimming pool. And then all of a sudden it was juxtaposed with the fact that I was at school and that I was just starved. I hadn’t eaten in a few days. And two or three people that I know – they were like girls, I guess, I don’t know who they were – but they were supposed to give me lunch. And they got this big thing of pretzels, a big thing of chicken nuggets and a big cup of soda for all of us. And I had to go do some other errands before I could get there to get to them, but I was running through the school because when I’d go past the boys’ bathroom and the boys flush the toilet, it goes, “Flahhhhhhb,” kind of like a bathroom tub faucet or shower thing. And so they had flabbing toilets and flabbing sinks in the boys’ bathroom at school. So I had to run past that. Then I had to run through a really vulnerable area where the fire alarms would go off at any moment. And I finally got over to in front of the cafeteria where they waiting for me, and somehow I had the notion that a few feet away from us was the boys’ bathroom that had flabbing toilets and sinks. And they had a big thing of pretzels and a big thing of chicken nuggets and a big cup of coke, and I started eating a pretzel or two and the girls were all kind of getting silly and laughing and stuff. And I ate a chicken nugget, and I was going to take a drink of soda, but I spilled the whole darned thing, and I was so mad. And I was sure that they thought I was little blind gooch (?). And then the boys’ toilet went “Flahhhhb” and I got all nervous and spilled something else. And then all of a sudden that was juxtaposed with the fact that I was laying down in the living room while Mom and Dad were watching TV and I realized that I had fulfilled my duty in playing my part in the mermaid story at the swimming pool, and so that was that. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2319,,,,,,,03-16-2014,"(331) Last night I had the craziest dream that I’ve had in a while. Well, not really, but kind of. To start with I don’t know if I was up here or in my home state, but I was at this bar with Mom and a few other people, I think one or two of my friends too. And there was this machine there, this vending machine, that you would put a quarter in and you would put a square, rectangular piece of bendy plastic in. It was like three dimensional. And then the machine would play a tune like “Old MacDonald” or “London Bridge” or some kids’ song like that, while it was making the kid a figure. And it had like a little window where you could watch it through. And I can’t remember, it wasn’t scary, but the machine played “London Bridges” and “Blue Bird” and a couple other things like that, but some of them I couldn’t recognize. And I don’t know what that had to do with anything, but I also, at this bar I was supposed to set up the sound system and do something, record something, I guess. And I didn’t have the Peavey system; I had this big clunky thing. And somehow I made a recording with my voice talking over some music that’s playing and making some announcements and stuff. And later on I played it back on my personal CD player. And it was so loud, my voice was like clipping, and I couldn’t turn the volume down. It was like almost making me deaf, and it was like making my teeth rattle. And that was kind of crazy. And so I figured, “Next time I have got to pay more attention to the V meters, and they had these racks of equipment and they had a tape recorder, a CD recorder and a couple other things like the radio station does. And I had to stand on a chair and I still couldn’t see all the meters well enough. So then I kind of woke and went to a different scene. Then I fell back to sleep and I dreamt that Dad came up here. He drove up here and I had another week to go of vacation in my dream. And he kind of like surprised us like Uncle Bob did at the farm that one day. But it wasn’t a real pleasant surprise for me because this vacation is like supposed to be us away from home, and so he drove up here, and I thought, “Oh no, he’s going to be tagging along with us the next week and he’s going to rain on our parade.” And he also saying things like, “Well, we should drive home together when your week is up. You shouldn’t have to fly home. We should all drive home together.” And I was like, “Oh no,” that’s the worst thing I could hear because, you see, I’m so grateful that flying gets us there in a few hours, but driving takes days on end. And it’s like boring when it’s just the three of us. And somehow they made it out to be more of a hassle to fly than to drive, so I dreamt that we were going to lose some morning because we didn’t use our tickets, and we were going to have to drive home. And then I woke up, fortunately. Let’s see, I’m trying to remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2320,,,,,,,,"(194) Finally over with this crazy month. Last night I dreamt that we were at Ginnie Springs and that we were getting ready to go swimming. And we were at the springs and I realized that I was still fully dressed and I forgot my bathing suit. So I like went back to the camp site, or I thought I was going back to the camp site to get it, but I couldn’t find my way back and I came back several times to ask for directions. And then I finally realized that my time’s getting short and it’s really not important whether or not I had my bathing suit. So I ripped off my clothes and went in skinny dipping. And that would have been just fine if there weren’t three or four rappy boys standing around with a personal CD player and stuff. But in my dream I didn’t care, and just jumped in. And then I think I swam around for a little while. It was pretty shallow. And then we got out of the water and we went, we got back in the car, and then I think the kids suddenly appeared. They weren’t there before, but they like suddenly appeared. And we were going to some hotel, and I was thinking how, what a shame it was that the radio got shut off and there was a really good song on. And then I had the notion that I was looking at Sound and Vision in the back seat of the car. And then I remember, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, that I had the notion that the radio on my nightstand was on and it was playing the same song. And that I didn’t need to worry about it being shut off in the car. But when I actually woke up and regained full consciousness, of course, it wasn’t on. It wasn’t like the alarm was on and it turned on or anything. It was just in my dream, I thought it was. Well, I don’t know, that was an okay dream. I keep having dreams about Ginnie Springs; I wonder what that could mean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2324,,,,,,,,"(290) Last night I had an absurd dream, and the tape is probably going to flip any minute, so beware. I dreamt that I was at Ace Field on a Saturday and Frederick was showing me this hand-held, real heavy device that reminded me of, it was about the size of the talking calculator, but it was a little heavier. It was some kind of audio editing device, and it was kind of a bluish color and it had a real wide LCD display. And it had a few keys along the bottom and a few up the side. And Frederick was seeing that the labels were unusually large and they could actually see all of them. And he wanted to make sure I could see all of them by asking me where to find the keys that went up or down, the volume ____. And I found them like in the bottom right area, and I upped the CD about three or four notches. And then I realized that in order to edit audio and put programs together, that I had to have these – what’s the material? – I had to have these clay alphabet letter blocks, and a lot of them were attached together vertically in a column, and some were loose. And I didn’t know what I had to do with these alphabet letter blocks, but I had a feeling it was like making a story board for a movie. And there was also this book that was like the length of a novel that went with it. And Frederick was going to try to teach me a few things so that I could make an order, because I had a notion that I was having a party that evening and I was going to make a border for the playlist for the party. And then we like ran out of time and he let me just take the thing home and learn some stuff on my own and show it to him on Monday, because he realized we weren’t going to have any more time before the party. I remember looking at the time and it was 4:50 and I had to get home because the party was at 6:00. So then I make my way to the front and up the, I mean down the elevator, and I realize that I’m at Sycamore Gardens and I ask the lady at the front to use the phone because I dug in my purse and I didn’t have the cell phone. And her phone was like whacko. It was like you would pick it up and instead of a dial tone, there was this commercial for like Spanish food, and you had to actually push a number before it would have a thing. And so first I dialed 566-8554 and realized that wasn’t the one, so put it down and tried again. And then I dialed our land line and I don’t think I got through. Before I finished, I hung up and there was, so I’m going to say that before I could get through, Mom came and picked me up, which was good, so I didn’t have to call. She picked me up in the parking lot, and instead of the car, she had the blue car that was like all beat up and these broken windows and this yuckiness, and I kind of was a little startled, I was like, “Where did you get this?” and she was like, “It’s Joan’s.” And she said that it was a special model that was made to look like this to show that it had been through the war.

I was quite satisfied with the boat. When we left the dock area, we drove the boat out the channel between two pieces of land. They seemed to have rather, you know, stone sea walls. There were high trees along the water edge, and this channel wasn't straight out to the ocean. It went at right angles kind of out. When we got back, I got in an argument with a man over the merits of an Evinrude over a Johnson. I was all for the new Johnson with an inboard and outboard drive.

This canal was a continuous canal with a lot of turns and much of the time I recall was spent driving the boat down these canals.

2791,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:sam details,10-28-2013,"7 M I dreamed I was out with a friend whom I hadn't seen for a long time, a boy Eddie Book bounder. We were out on a double date or triple date. There were several couples and we had a picnic right along the Miami River somewhere. Eddie had this blanket spread out on the river. This was rather unusual. He said it wasn't so unusual for him because he could fly, and he did fly. He was flying along. We asked him how he could fly. He couldn't fly too high, maybe 100 feet or so. This was pretty interesting. I wanted to know how fast he could come straight down and stop before crashing to the ground. He could come down pretty fast and stop. We looked real close at the river, and he seemed to have a sand bag on which he had his thing on because the girl who was with him walked out on the blanket, and it didn't sink in the river. It was probably right across a sand bar. Hall: They were on a picnic, and they weren't in cars, but they were walking. Sam didn't recognize any of the other people he was with except for Eddie. Eddie wasn't lying on the blanket. He was just lying up in the air. It was kind of a swimming-like motion that Eddie was making to fly. The blanket was spread out on the river and not on the road. The blanket was actually on a sand bar rather than right on the river itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2793,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:sam details,10-28-2013,"16 M I was sitting on the floor talking to Dr. Van de Castle about skin diving. This boy came in. I didn't recognize him particularly. He thrust a hot rod magazine in my face, and he said something to the effect that, ""Look, this is my club"" or something. ""Here's a picture of us."" I wasn't particularly impressed by this. I was looking at the magazine, and they had an article on brakes and how you stop your car on a long hill to test your brakes. I thought it was a good thing we don't have a lot of large hills around because I would probably have to buy brakes for my car. Then the scene changed. I was talking to my wife. I was arguing with my wife. She wanted to go with me somewhere, I forget now where I was going. She couldn't go because she couldn't leave the baby alone. She said the baby was sleeping and he wouldn't wake up. Apparently I lost the argument because she went with me. Then I woke up. I don't know where I was going. Hall: The boy of whom Sam speaks in the dream is about 20 years old, and Sam knows this boy. He's a rather obstreperous young man. The picture in the hot rod magazine showed this boy's club and he was in the picture. The article about the brakes pointed out that you should test your brakes on a long hill, and Sam thought, said, that there were no long hills around Miami to test on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2794,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:sam details,10-28-2013,"13 M I dreamed I was with my mother and stepfather and my oldest brother. One of my father's friends, Rossman, in an apartment. It looked like the one we had in the Lakeshore Hotel about 8 years ago. I had just recovered from an operation. It was as if my arm had been amputated and elevated, put back on higher on the shoulders. I had a functional arm and the stub of the old arm, but it didn't bother me particularly because I had use of the good arm. Ross was asking me why I wanted to be a doctor. I said, ""It's nice. That's the way it goes. You have to be something in this life. As long as you have to be something, you might as well be something that does good and has prestige and high status."" He said he didn't particularly need that. In fact, he said he didn't need to be anything. I said it's alright, but it's hard to eat like that. I was late. It kept getting hot and cold in the apartment, and I remember turning the heat down and then it got cold and we'd turn the heat back up and it was too hot. Turn the heat off. Then I walked down to where the bedrooms were, and my mother was lying in bed crying. I asked her what was wrong. She was crying because she had hardening of the arteries. I told her not to worry. Tomorrow we can go over to the VA and have her checked. There was a girl involved. She was kind of fuzzy. She just kept appearing and disappearing. Hall: The name of the man who comes into the dream is Ross Madden. He died last year of a heart attack while he was in the hospital for having his legs straightened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2795,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:nietzsche details,10-28-2013,"2 R I was shown a diamond ring by someone, I believe by my girlfriend's father, who happens to be a jeweler. I thought it was fairly attractive at the time and I showed it to my girlfriend who said no, that she thought it was rather small and cheap. I kind of agreed with her. I think the price on it was about $175 and we had planned to spend about $300 for a ring. Then later on her father, or whoever it was that was selling the ring, showed it to some other man, an old man I've never seen before. He said immediately yes, he would like to buy it. So I was thinking, gee, what a fool that he wants to buy that dinky ring. In fact, he offered my girlfriend's father about $300 or $350 for the ring, which again I thought was very foolish. But then he said, ""Well, look at this ring. It's beautiful."" I looked at it and it had at least three very large, beautifully formed diamonds and many small ones. Even the small ones were at least a quarter of a karat large. So I remember thinking at the time that gee, we missed a very good buy. I was rather disappointed. That was about the only emotion in the dream, slight, not great, but slight disappointment at the end. The setting was kind of nonexistent. I don't remember setting at all really. Of course, the characters I knew, my girlfriend and her father. I didn't know the man at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't remember anything about the transaction or the scene I saw. There may not have been anything beyond that. I was driving out of a place that was apparently an Air Force base. I would assume that it was Whiteman, I mean Homestead Air Force Base, and I picked up a service man. He was a sergeant that was colored, and he indicated to me that he wanted to go to the Ale House. I could see myself coming through the gate, and he was standing. He had already passed through the gate and was standing not alongside the road like a hitchhiker normally would, but standing right in the very middle of the road, just standing there. I recall his waving his hands over his head to halt me down. He was very pleased that he got the ride. It was dark, really dark, not like early evening, but more like the middle of the night sometime, that dark. And I can remember that the Air Force uniforms were exceptionally brilliant as far as the blue was concerned, even though it was very dark. The blue shown much more brilliantly than it is in actual life. That's it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2797,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:sam details,10-28-2013,"16 S I was in a house. It was either my aunt's house or my uncle's house. I think it was my mother's house. We were having a Christmas party, and we were all sitting around drinking wine. There were several little bottles of wine around. Some of them had green tin foil on the ends and some had pink tin foil on the ends. I think they were Paul Masson, and the wines kind of ran out and nobody got high or anything. I guess you can't get high unless you really try. I went in the kitchen and my uncle was out in the kitchen. This is an uncle I'm very close to, and I was making some coffee, instant coffee. The coffee was already moist, and I put it in the cup and it wasn't mixing very well. There were little clumps of coffee that hadn't dissolved in hot water. Then I was stirring it, and he said, ""Here, let me stir mine,"" and he was stirring his. That was when I woke up. Hall speaking: This Christmas party, which didn't have any Christmas decorations, but Sam felt it was Christmas. It was his mother and his uncle whom he has already mentioned, and his uncle's wife, that is, his aunt, and there were some other people too. They were some of his friends, but he doesn't remember who they were. They were drinking wine out of those little bottles.

I appeared to be meeting her indoors. Inside as opposed to outside. I guess it was a house. It wasn't an auditorium or anything. I seem to be talking in the dream. I can remember that I was the principal speaker. I guess it was conversation because I was meeting new people. Apparently I was telling a story of some kind because I was talking for a long time. What other people do, or were asking questions, and I was relating an anecdote or something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2799,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:nietzsche details,10-28-2013,"1 S This dream was a lot of fun. My girlfriend and I were somewhere. We were somewhere out in the city of Miami. It was late at night and I was fairly old, perhaps about 40-45. It was rather indefinite and she was about her age, that she is now. I was a lot older than her. I was kind of trying to seduce her. That is as a general plan, that wasn't the specific plan of the evening, but that was our relationship, one of 40-year-old seducer and young seducee. We were out there in the city somewhere late at night, and we were talking about our relationship a little bit. Of course, she wasn't listening too closely, as any flighty young girl would when talking to a seducer. But the whole point was that I hadn't been able to seduce her yet. I was getting kind of impatient and I thought perhaps this wasn't the best thing for me to try to continue attempting to seduce her. Perhaps she needed something else. I was feeling rather sorry for myself too because I really had a lot of feeling for the girl, and I mean I desired her quite a bit also. In any case, while we were standing there, all of a sudden we started to see a lot of trucks with lights on them going by as we were talking. Funny kind of trucks. Perhaps they were kind of like jeeps. They had a lot of lights on them and they would go by, go by, and finally there was kind of one near us and we walked over to it and I was kind of looking at it. It was like a fire truck or something. Just after we had seen the first trucks go off, took off away from us, these two young guys about college age, that is about my girlfriend's age, not mine, had gone rushing off after them, and there had been some cryptic remark at the time by someone else that it was probably the two frat boy's frat house that was on fire, that all the trucks were going to. So there were kind of fire trucks evidently. So then I was kind of looking under the wheels of one of these fire trucks. I was standing there and I was getting a statement for some reason from the president of the university, a statement to the effect that the statement I had gotten before about the statement that he had given me, were all true. Namely, that it was the case that something or other, but I can't remember what, in other words, I was getting real official statements from the president about statements he had given me so that there could be no misunderstanding when I took him to court or wherever I wanted to take him. Then this fellow here woke me up. Very disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pen is 5-sided and it's about shoulder high. It's made of long white boards. I asked the owner if he thought this was bad that all his cattle were gone. He said yes. He had only 6 left out of 75. My wife was with me on the previous day or preceding the loss of the cattle incident, we had gone out and seen a ranch which was a rather flat thing with a few hills around the horizon. The owner of the ranch was a friendly older person, female. This pen the cattle were in, originally it was packed full of cattle, just shoulder to shoulder, almost level across the top. Of course, in the morning one whole side was down, and the cattle were all gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The next morning on the way home, I turned left to go down towards the Fla. Pharmacy, down towards the Grove House. My buddy lives in the Grove. This truck went through a green light. We were coming straight thru Grand Ave. He was coming towards me and hit me in the side, and he kept on going. He didn't stop. Really smashed the car up. The police came and everything. We couldn't find the truck. Looked all over for the truck. In looking for the truck, we walked down the hill towards the boats and there was another bad accident down there, but I wasn't involved in that one. The truck wasn't there. I was walking back and I saw this other guy looking around. He looked like one of the guys in the truck. He was in some building, I don't know which building, and I caught up with him and he said he didn't know anything about it. That's all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2802,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:sam details,10-28-2013,"9 M I dreamed that apparently it was my mother-in-law had some relatives come down to stay at the big house next door. There were quite a few of them altogether. We were all over there at the large house eating. One of the girls got something in her eye. One of the older men took it out with a handkerchief. Then they asked me what I thought of that for doctoring. I said, ""Fine, as long as you use a clean handkerchief."" Then one of them was using a tractor towing, it was a large tractor towing a small grass cutter at the end of a long rope to cut the grass. As he made his turn, I noticed that the line had gotten tangled up, but someone ran out and straightened it when he started pulling the lawn mower again. Some of the kids were playing in the far back of the house, and there seemed to be an excess of water back there. It was like grounds under water. That's about it. Hall: He didn't recognize who the girl and man were, but he thinks they were relatives. There were not only his wife's relatives, but his family was over to this big house. The man who was driving the tractor and the lawn mower was known to Sam. He's a physician here in town. That's wrong. This M.D. is a relative of Sam's wife. Sam doesn't remember if any of his family was there, just his wife's family. The kids that were playing out in the yard were some of her relatives too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then Roger came in with a piece of the EEG and she said that my eye movements were very sharp and distinct and they were really good. I must have been having a vivid dream. Then I was walking across this large, wide open space on the roof of the med school building there. It's brick on top, but there's nothing but blue sky up above. I looked back and this girl Phyllis was following me and that was it. Day residue: Practically the whole dream was day residue. The day before I had spent some time having coffee in the coffee shop in the 6th floor of Jackson and there's a walk back from the coffee shop that's an open air with a brick floor.

2804,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:nietzsche details,10-28-2013,"5 R I was in my apartment with a girl whom I know and I was going to play a record on the record player. So I went over to the cabinet where I have components set up, my own components, and I noticed there was a wire loose from the amplifier and a spark jumped from the wire to the chassis of the amplifier, a couple of inches. I watched and then it jumped again after several seconds, so I was a little worried about that, of course, I kind of stood back to think of what to do. I didn't want that electricity flying around the room. All of a sudden it jumped across the room, perhaps 7, 8, 10 feet to a screwdriver that I have on a desk. So that really got me worried to see a big spark fly all the way cross the room. After another second or two, it flew again, perhaps a larger spark. I could kind of smell ozone in the air, and I thought to myself at the time that the spark must be ionizing the air and this must be creating a vacuum, and that a big vacuum was being created in the room. I threw the screwdriver over by the amplifier, thinking that perhaps the spark would now jump from the amplifier to the screwdriver, a short distance, but by now the spark was just jumping across the room by itself, large. So as I said, I thought about this making a vacuum in the room, so I started to run for the door. Then I thought just as I was reaching for the door, that if I open the door and run away, the spark will obviously get larger and larger out the door and will begin ionizing larger areas, the whole atmosphere, and the whole atmosphere will become a vacuum. But in any case, I thought that, but I still stood at the door and was about to open it when there was a giant implosion. That is, the room had become a vacuum and everything evidently, I guess it passed through my mind at the moment, had blown in from the pressure. Of course, that was the end of the dream. I woke up then or that's as far as I can remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2805,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:thor details,10-28-2013,"5 R There was one other brief, very sketchy dream that occurred and I don't know if it was after the last dream or before, sometime during the course of the evening I dreamed of myself going down thru some sort of a tunnel or going through a subterranean door or something and entering a cave or an open cavern. I don't know why I was there. Something proceeded my going in there. Some sort of a story, but I don't know what it was. I can only remember the scene of my being in there and little holes in the floor, four set in a square as on 4 corners of a box. Candles were inserted into these holes, and I had been instructed by someone to light these candles. In the scene was I there lighting these candles. I know that this wasn't a religious celebration of any kind, but rather I was told to do this to keep the animals away. It was some such idea. There was color in this dream. A good deal of it came with the yellow light. I could distinguish the color of the walls, the color of the candles, the color of the light of the candles coming from the candles. I can't identify any emotion or there were no other characters that I can recall, but this one scene which occurred sometime during the night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was this large pen full of turtles. You could see them moving their arms and legs back and forth. Some of the turtles, well, you couldn't see them all because they were right side up, but some of them were upside down. The ones that were upside down had these large holes drilled in the area of their sternum and you could see their little hearts were pumping. I was going to get some turtle food for these turtles. They were making swimming-like motions, but they weren't in any water. They were just all on top of each other. Sam felt he had to go get the food for the turtles because they couldn't get out and get it for themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2807,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:thor details,10-28-2013,"3 R The dream begins in a bedroom occupied by one other person--a man about 35--not familiar. We are asleep--he on one side of the room and I on the other. Then the scene shifts to outdoors--very much like woods at first. For some reason we are in a very old car (black) backing up across a road and into the woods. We are both wearing pajamas and are intending to sleep in the car alongside the road running through the woods. It is very dark and I can't see a thing, and because I am not sleepy, I am restless. The scene shifts again and I am alone in the car driving toward someone' s house. The scene shifts again and I am sitting on a huge rippling terrace of the Alice in Wonderland variety. There are two girls--twins--about 16 years old sitting in white iron lawn chairs on either side of me and an older woman, apparently their mother, in front of me sewing. I am staring at one girl because she appears to be daydreaming and while so doing, I begin to dream myself. It has been broad daylight since I arrived here, yet I am dreaming a nocturnal sort of dream--awake, staring and sitting up. I can dimly hear a conversation going on between the other girl and her mother. I begin ""waking up"" and looking back and forth from the daydreaming girl to her sister and mother. The girl who was talking to her mother is now laying down on her back toying with a flower or something. A conversation ensues where I am saying, ""I once wondered if one could dream both in the past and present tenses at the same time, and now I know,"" or some such thing. I don't remember the comments after this, but it was snide and had a tang of ridicule on the part of the reclining girl and her mother. The other girl is still daydreaming. I don't know why, but I feel a liking for the dreaming girl, and a resentment for the other 2 characters. They seem like Cinderella, an ugly stepsister, and a mean stepmother. Neither girl is pretty and I am not attracted to them. In fact, I feel a paternal attitude. The scene shifts and I am back in the old car with the man--he is driving and it is backwards again on the same road. He passes the place where we were parked before, and so he pulls forward to the place. I light a cigarette with the old-fashioned car lighter and there is some confusion about getting the lighter back in the socket. Then we are walking down a river or canal and it is no longer a woods, but a jungle. Then we are at a grassy clearing alongside the river and the man is sleeping on some sort of elevated platform with me standing beside it looking into the river. I see (the moon is very bright and golden) in the water a huge clump of black snakes are swimming and become frightened and climb up on the platform where the man is asleep. Then the water becomes mired with hideous creatures flashing their teeth up at me. The grass in the clearing is suddenly teeming with creatures below me and I am too afraid to sleep. I see a snake slither through the grass, and then a pack of bright green rats. Then there is a pack of black and white tarantulas (or some such spider) just below. They are enormous for insects and I throw something at them, trying to disband them. When I hit one, it became angry and jumped up on the platform in the dark. At this point I was beside myself with horror and bolted upright in my bed--turning on the light and feeling frantically for a spider until I had fully awakened. <BR><BR> The next dream that I had and the longest, most involved, concerned myself at my parent's home somewhere. The dream began as I was, it was late at night and I was asleep and I woke just in time to see my little sister, my younger sister, who is approximately 15, sneaking her boyfriend thru my window and across my room, headed toward another part of the house. I called to her as the door opened, ""Diane,"" and she started to reopen the door and asked me what I wanted, but she knew what I wanted, so she changed her mind and went ahead and closed the door again because she didn't want to hear. I jumped out of bed and followed. I only recall getting to the other side of the house and looking out the window and seeing this boy headed off in the far blue yonder in his old beat up car. My sister never did reappear in the dream. What I did was to run outside and hop in my car, which was new, and began to chase this boy because I didn't like him, and I resented his being in the house and taking advantage of my sister. There is no indication and I never have considered that he was taking advantage of her in any sexual sense, rather he was taking advantage of her gullible personality, but she liked him and he wasn't worthy of such affection. For this reason I was tracking him down and I was chasing him the car. Somehow or another, he had an arrogant attitude about the whole thing. I could see his face as he drove, and it was as if he was pulling something over on me. Somehow the situation became reversed and he ended up chasing me, his car right behind mine. We were going down dark, narrow streets, very, very fast, just as fast as we could go--90 to 100 miles per hour, I assume. My dog was in the car with me. Great big dogs were running around chasing the wheels, large German Shepherds and collies and big mean boxers and everything were jumping up on to my car, trying to get to my dog and my dog was just barking at them and sort of coaxing them on. The size of these dogs was very exaggerated and they were leaping back and forth over the car like antelope and it was real frightening. Even though it was frightening in this way, I wasn't afraid. I was just angry that this guy was now on my tail and I recall as we sped along, we started to come up very rapidly in front of us, just someone who drove along, poking along. I tried to slow down and I slammed on my brakes. I could see in my rear view mirror that he was very tickled, very amused because he felt he had me under his finger. Even though I was chasing him, he knew that he had me, so to speak, over a barrel. I was becoming increasingly annoyed with this. As I slammed on my brakes, I barreled right into the rear end of this other man, broke the windshield and smashed up the front of my new car. I could see that he didn't care if he hit me, even though he had plenty of time not to. He or it didn't matter. He purposely slammed right into the back of me at which time I went into a most furious rage, which I think is the last I can remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2808,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:mac details,10-28-2013,"2 R This is a dream I remembered when I woke up. I remember being with a lot of people. It seems as though it was some sort of a picnic or something, like a company picnic. They were all playing volleyball and swimming and everything. It wasn't at a park though. It seemed like it was between a couple houses, and I remember they were playing volleyball in the back yard of one house. Next door there was a swimming pool and there were people swimming. I remember I got the volleyball and I kicked it. It went real high and I remember that it came down a couple houses away. It didn't seem to disturb the volleyball game though. They just went right on. I remember saying that I made a field goal when I went and retrieved the ball __. The last thing I remember was that I was swimming and then seemed to be racing with someone, a girl. I don't know who she was, but I remember that I was ahead of her and that she beat me just at the end. I stopped or slowed down or something and she passed me up. As far as colors, I remember the color, the water color. I remember the color of all the people, the skin color. That's the whole dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2809,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:thor details,10-28-2013,"11 S My first recollection of this dream picks up somewhere along a highway and I'm riding in a car with my family. It's an old car, a very old car, about a '53 Pontiac. The paint is very dull and I think it was the typical Pontiac green color. Anyway, it was rainy and drizzly. We were riding in the car and passing a woman hitchhiking on the highway, and I thought this was very unusual. A few hundred yards beyond there for some reason or another, something went wrong with the car. My father was driving and pulled the car over. This woman was just down the road. We all got out of the car and fooled around, looking at a tire or something. A few words passed between my mother and I, but I don't know exactly what they were. Somehow we were back in the car about to leave, as we hadn't left. As we got back in the car, oh now I remember. While we were sitting there, we invited the woman, I should call her girl from down the road, to sit in the car and stay warm. It was drizzly. As we were climbing back into the car, the back seat, I believe, we were saying to her that we were going the other way and she was saying, ""Oh no."" So we made her get out, but before doing so, arrangements were made, somehow or another, to meet her again somehow. Next thing I recall was driving into Washington, D.C. I remember looking around and I even remember the view as I came in the White House was on my left. As we came past the White House, the Capitol began to show right behind it. Right in front of me as we were going down the street was the Washington Monument. Of course, the city is not set up this way, but anyway this is the way it was in the dream, and I remember remarking over and over, ""God, the White House is filthy dirty. It's not white."" We continued and stopped the car somewhere around there for some reason that I can discern. We're out marching in front of the White House, either the White House or the Capitol, and it was my father and I and we were going to do some work on a couple of marble slabs out in the terrace of the White House or something like that. I remember as we were standing around discussing it, he handed me the car keys and told me to go back and get our tools because we had forgotten them. I got awfully mad about this and told him, ""Why should I go do it while you're just standing around here?"" The whole time while I was saying this, I was thinking about this girl who had something to do with it, but I don't understand what. At this point it becomes pretty hazy. I don't recall exactly what transpired between now and the next scene, but at the next scene we seem to be driving into what seems rather familiar. It seems like Miami. It seems like the surroundings of Miami, yet we're all calling it California. It looked like Miami to me, but anyway it was supposed to be Calif. And we had already made prearrangements to pick up this girl. By a bridge on the way into town. She was there. She got in the car and she had the appearance of being a conglomeration of several girls that I've known in the past. She looked like all of them. Whichever one it was primarily, I found her extremely attractive and I was in love with this girl, but it never came to that. This was the feeling though. This was the emotion I felt in the dream. From here there was some chatter about finding her a job and a place to live, something because my parents were responsible for her. I don't know why they were responsible, but somehow she was in their custody. The girl was dropped off and told to go look for some place. She didn't want to, but she was told anyway to go ahead and we all would be back later to get her. Then we'd all spend the day together or something like that. It was only a matter of a couple of hours and we were back. She was supposed to have found a job and a place to live and all that. I don't know where we were. Sitting in a restaurant, all of us. My father was perpetuating some sort of fraud with someone because I remember him saying to someone that the place she found to live was a specific address. Then the last thing I remember seeing was a newspaper lying across the table with this address written across the front page in headlines. The headline was that this girl had found an apt. I remember thinking just before I woke up that this was a lie. This wasn't true. He was lying that this girl was living at this address because I knew differently. This was just an address of some property that my father had owned or rented or had some association with, but was gone now. He sold it. I knew this official was questioning him where the girl was staying, and I knew he was lying. This is at the point where I woke up, I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2810,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:thor details,10-28-2013,"2 A This version of the dream was transcribed by Al on the tape-recorder the next day. The first record of the dream began early in the evening, sometime around mealtime. I had no definite plans for the night and I ended up by getting dressed and going somewhere that I can't identify where I went, but somewhere during the course of the evening even though I didn't have a date. I acquired one in some fashion or another and had a very good time. And after the date I recalled that I stopped off to see some friends or something to round out the evening very well. Anyway, as it ended up, I was in very good spirits on my way home, having had what I considered to be a very pleasant evening. The scene shifts then to me parked at the curb outside of the fraternity house where apparently I was living and it was raining very hard. And as I opened the door of the car which was a long, sleek black Dodge, a car which I despise. A girl came walking past the car, a girl whom I cannot identify specifically, but who seemed very familiar and she stood outside the car, and the door was open and I had my legs outside the car. And she was laughing and hollering because she was getting soaking wet. And she told me to hurry up so we could go into the house together and apparently this was a co-ed house or something where men and women were living, which is very strange because it was supposed to be a fraternity house. Nonetheless, I thought nothing of it at the time, and I was sitting there collecting things off the dashboard, cigarettes, lighter, small change and things--in other words, not jumping right out the car and dashing into the house as one would expect in heavy rain. And this is why she was laughing and hollering so much--it was so funny--she was just standing there getting drenched and we both thought it was very hilarious. Finally, we did go into the house and the scene ended. It picked up again --it may have been later of the next day or it may have been the following weekend whatever I was then with this other girl--the girl who had passed by the car whom I had run into the house with and apparently I had seen her previous to the time I had gone out or the week before when I had acquired this unknown date when I had such a very good time and apparently I had told her something to the effect that I didn't know what I was going to do and so forth, so as the evening began, she was reprimanding me in a mild, kidding, almost patronizing, paternal sort of way about the fact that poor little I had gone out and had a very bad time with the boys or riding about town worthlessly and that I shouldn't do these things. I couldn't seem to convince her that the fact was I hadn't had a miserable time as she was inferring. I really had a very pleasant time. I had spent a wholesome evening with a wholesome girl and enjoyed myself rather than being out shooting pool or something. It wasn't a very clear conversation but that was the gist of it--a reprimand. Then the scene shifts again. This is strange--as we were starting out--the reprimand took place while we were driving and it seemed that we were starting out from the fraternity house where we were both living and when the scene shifted we were back at the fraternity house, entering the front door and we were very dressed up in formal attire, apparently in our way into a dance because there was music coming from the ballroom off to the left and an air of festivity throughout the place, in the lobby as I--a smile on the hat-check man and so forth--this is the point where Gary awakened me but there's a great deal of description beyond this. I never at any time during the dream had an image of the two girls who played a part in the dream. I could feel their presence. I knew that they were there--I could sense what kind of girls they were, but I could not actually see an image of a face before me. Even so I knew what the second girl looked like. I could tell that she was tall and slender, and I could tell that I was not attracted to her in any physical or sexual sense--that rather I felt a very close comradeship. I liked this girl very much as a friend. I didn't seem to feel any sisterly attraction to her as I mentioned to Gary last night, but it could have been, but the only two people with whom I've had such a cordial, kidding relationship that I can think of--that is, girls--was last year--and one of them may have fit the description of the girl in this dream. She was sort of a clown. She is the only one I could identify the character in the dream with. However, I didn't see her face, so I don't know. As for the first girl, she was my conception of extremely attractive, even though I didn't see her face, I knew how she was built. She was small, that is, in the vicinity of 5'4""--very well built--a cute, pretty, wholesome appearance. All this I sensed. I never really saw any of it. The other strange thing was this fraternity house as I stood in the lobby wondering whether I should check this girl's coat, really didn't have the appearance of a fraternity house, but rather had the appearance of an officer's club. The only thing strange was that it appeared to be like the Officer's Club at the Washington Heights military base in Tokyo where I had gone frequently years ago to attend different social functions, a place of which I have pleasant memories. It was not like a college place, but had a sophisticated flavor to the whole thing. The only color I can recall--most of it was combination of black, white and grays, but there was one place--a lot of dim colors just as we entered the fraternity house--the place (the lobby) was lighted like a night club--blue-black appearance coming from the ballroom -- rather yellowish lights--lobby colorfully decorated--cannot conjure up any specific colors. As I sat outside the fraternity house in the car, it reminded me of the time when I sat outside the teenage club and kidded with the people--light-hearted, gay, banter--very pleasant dream--pleasant social interactions. This version varies in only two substantive ways from the dream as reported on awakening. First, Thor had had a date with the first girl, he had gone to pick her up and she was not ready, so he had gone to visit and have some drinks with friends (mixed sex). Second, the man at the hat-check counter was looking sour rather than smiling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2811,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:thor details,10-28-2013,"4 R It consisted of my dreaming that Gary had 2 girls in the house while he was monitoring, and I was asleep. I think I can identify these girls as the 2 girls we saw last night, Janet and Ellen, but I couldn't be certain of that, but I would think so as I remember it. Anyway, the air of the whole affair seemed to be very gay and efficient, but light, cheerful. After I woke, I was sitting in front of the bar by the kitchen. Gary was behind the bar. I began arguing with one of the girls over the cake. I had baked a banana cake and she had baked a fudge cake. I don't know when, but they were both around, and I was sampling a piece of each. The argument came up about who baked the better cake. She insisted that she did. Of course, I knew better. She said the reason that my cake wasn't as good as hers was because I didn't use any lard in it. I insisted that I could make it better with oleo margarine. It was really silly because I don't think you use lard in cakes anyway, at least who would want to eat it. Even though we were arguing over this thing, I didn't get angry really because she was rubbing my back throughout the whole discussion rather good-naturedly. I was very pleased with this. Then she leaned over and kissed me on the back and I woke up. Where this idea of lard came into my mind, I can only think of that when we were at the grocery store yesterday, I happened to notice a very large jar of white material which I didn't know what it was, and I went over and looked at it and it was lard. I found it rather curious because this was something I never had occasion to use. It just caught my eye, so perhaps that's where the thought came from. That was all of it. Just a brief note. There was some color in the dream. The color of the cakes, chocolate-colored cake, and the banana cake was white.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2812,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:erik details,10-28-2013,"13 M In this dream I was going to my home and I don't know where I'd been. I know I was going to my house and it was getting dark, and I wanted to take a short cut, so I took a short cut. It was a little, winding, narrow, wooded road and I had a big flashlight in front of me. And I just kept running down this road, just kept running and running and running down this road. It was kind of hilly. And when I got to the top of this hill, I was pretty tired out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2813,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:erik details,10-28-2013,"2 R I had two very short dreams last night. The first one I dreamt that Dr. Hall was taking the tape from my eye, the tape that covers my eye, and when he had taken it off my left eye, I didn't have any eyebrows on that eye. They had gone. The second dream was very vague. All I can remember is I was piloting a big DC-8 jet liner, big passenger jet, and I was flying around snow at the time and there was, if I remember right, an avalanche that was coming down. I was flying underneath a mountain that an avalanche was coming down. I believe in the dream that I flew out of the avalanche just in time, though. I don't remember any other persons being in the second dream. That's all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2815,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:george details,10-28-2013,"5 M The end of the dream was again, this time it was an airplane carrying the boss, the boss of a company, something like this and was landing at the airport. Every time it seems I'm part of the controls as far as following it in, guiding it and such. We were just watching it. The executive was old, not old but 60's, baldheaded, heavy a little bit, not heavy, just a little. Just a typical-looking executive boss. By controls I was referring to it's almost like sitting up in the control tower watching the airplane land down on the field. However, I didn't see a setting that would represent a control tower. It was just the position I was in and the anxiety that I seemed to have as the airplane came in. These anxieties weren't anything different than a normal person watching a plane come in. They were in the other dream also of the airplane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2817,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"4 R This dream seems to have taken place quite a bit in the past, almost in, let's say, the 17 hundreds just for the heck of it. The beginning of the dream is a little weird. There's a scene of people all gathered around a snowy hill, all in a very happy mood, watching a barrel. A metal barrel about six feet in diameter and 10 ft. long with a bunch of kids in it sliding down a hill. This is quite a great convention and down comes a man roaring down on a barrel stay and goes over a ski jump. He falls flat on his face. Everybody roars down the hill and they are all on barrel stay skis too. It turns out most of them go over the jump and land right on top of him. They pull him up and brush the snow off him. Everybody as I say is in a real jolly mood. The thing is for skiing on this place, you always had to hike back up the hill. Because this is a little bit hard, it would make things so much easier if they had an automatic way to get up the hill, a ski-lift. The guy that everybody just skied over on top of things, he's going to build one. He's going to have the idea. The next thing he does, he goes over and takes a look at where they have put some logs up to hold a bank back, the idea being that he is going to try to make a ski lift on much the same principle. That is, taking a bunch of logs and building a straight inclined plane right up the slope, and then attaching a rope at the bottom so it can pull up, let's say a cart or something so you can always get up the hill and ski easily. Now it suddenly becomes dinner time, and everybody begins to leave the scene. Myself and another few people are left talking there about this invention when one of the members happens to hit a tree. A turkey, a wild turkey comes out of the brush. Well, he's in real thick underbrush and can't really do much, so we want to get him for dinner. I go around in back and poke at him with a ski pole while the other members of the party get in front of him and grab him. This is an old man and an old woman. They get him and they take him back. The scene shifts to a barn, and in this there's a bird about the size of a partridge or rough grouse. I start going after this one. Finally I corner the thing and grab it. Take that in too. Also in there I find a chicken, after some work and holding onto the rough grouse, I get the chicken too. I manage to come back with both of these and in a pretty jovial mood. I bring these into a big kitchen which is somewhat of a modern kitchen. There the lady of the house has got a small chicken she has just bought in one of the stores, and she likes the thing a lot because of the way it's been dressed. She thinks it is a very good buy. Here the dream ends. I have no idea where the dream came from or any interpretation of it. The characters well all unfamiliar. I was not the principle character. The principle character I would say was the man who was trying to build the ski lift. There were several people in the dream. The woman who was happy about the chicken seemed to have been my mother. I'm not sure about this. This is just the impression I got.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2818,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:erik details,10-28-2013,"2 A I dreams I was evidently in some foreign country and I was at the base of some type of shrine or temple. I remember to my left there were stairs, a long series of what might have been marble stairs, or stone stairs, leading up. In back of me was some kind of a (I'll draw a picture of that tomorrow). There was a person standing next to me at the base of the steps and it was a male individual, who it was I don't know. The only thing tha tI can remember saying is, ""The unforeseeable future."" What I was talking about I don't know. But I do remember saying those words. [picture at bottom: D. characterized this as being a Christian symbol.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2819,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"7 R There's something in this dream, there's a large city. I won't say for sure but it reminds me of Boston to some degree. It could be New York. It could be anyplace. I'm a Fuller Brush man again. This time selling very much in the center of a city, apartments. The dream started when my boss picked me up to take me to my area to sell. I remember I parked my car, met him, and he took me a couple of miles through the city. He wants to go down expressways to this area that I was to sell in. In his car he had 2 daughters about 4 or 5 years of age. I can't remember too much of the details of the actual selling. It didn't seem as if it were too successful though. As I say, I was in apartment houses. After it was all over, I met him again and we started back. I remember he was telling me not to be too worried about the way I did because that area was quite hard to sell in any way. Then we started back on some expressway. We reached a very large hill and started down it. I remember he put the brake on to slow ourselves down because he was going about 70 miles an hour going down this hill. Just as he put the brake on, he seemed to almost just collapse. He moved forward and hit his head on the windshield, then just slumped down in the seat. Well, this threw the car out of control. I remember I didn't panic at all. I just merely reached over and grabbed the wheel. I kept us going straight. Then I had to push myself over on the seat and somehow managed to get him out of the way so I could get a hold of the brake pedal. This took a while, but I finally reached it and just as I was beginning to put the brake down to slow us down I woke up. I just might mentioned a few other things. The car we were driving was a '55 Ford. This is not the car that Moss has. He has a Corvair. Also the hill we were going down is certainly no place in Boston or no place else I've ever seen before. This is a monstrous hill. In front of us there were 2 trucks, so if we had gone out of control, it would have been quite bad. The daughters in the front seat, they were also in the front seat with me. There were 4 of us in the front seat, and they were frightened, but not too frightened. I guess that's about all. A few more things I remember about the dream. It was really cold, which was another thing that made me think it was a northern city. Also we were going down this hill, I can remember I was trying to get the car into neutral also. I don't know why, but I sort of tried to do it without the clutch too--just tried to pull the gear shift lever into neutral. It was a standard shift car. As for emotions in the dream, I would say it was fairly neutral even right up to the point where we were going down this hill. I can remember when this first happened. I thought what a terrible situation we were in, but then I controlled myself. I just said, ""Don't panic."" I just calmly tried to grab the wheel and push my boss out of the way so I could get to the brake pedal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2820,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:george details,10-28-2013,"4 S A small airplane is seen flying. I seem to be flying it as it goes through its flight program. I seem to also see scenes from a picture, a movie, but just possibly readjusted with the inclusion of different character. Both of these incidents are happening at the same time. I was referring to the flying of the airplane, the landing of the airplane to someone else. The situation was as if the person I was talking to was in the picture, and I was also in the picture. It's a little bit difficult to exactly explain the setup because the feelings that were conveyed in the dream are difficult to duplicate over tape. Recognition of anyone else in the dream was next to nil. It was one of those things I knew I was talking to someone. I assumed I was referring to someone or talking to them. However, a description would almost be impossible to clearly describe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2821,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:erik details,10-28-2013,"3 R This dream started, if I remember, I was just being dismissed from a Marine Corps drill, and it happened to be in an airport. And I went immediately when I was dismissed over to one of the planes. And one of the planes that I remember vividly was a yellow beach craft bonanza. It was the plane that I got into. If I remember correctly, I had a choice between one with a yellow stripe and one with a red and yellow stripe. I took the yellow stripe bonanza, but it wasn't mine. It was somebody else's, and he flew it, some unidentifiable friend of mine whose plane it was. We took off and circled around the rest of the guys that were in this Marine Corps organization, and I remember thinking about how impressed everybody would be that I would be in this beautiful plane, this real fast plane, that it's a real sleek, real good-looking airplane. And then if I remember right, the friend that was flying me to get where we had to go -- I think we were going over to his house, I don't believe it was my house, it might have been -instead of flying through the air, we flew through a tunnel, a real long, long tunnel. It was a well-lit tunnel. I remember going real fast through this tunnel. And on one of our voyages through this tunnel, we either landed purposely or the plane stopped, and one of my professors, the professor I have for oral interpretation, came out of the wall. It all seemed very logical, him coming from someplace in this tunnel where he was having a class at that time. And he was asking me what I was doing there during a school day; it was Thursday. And I told him that I didn't have any classes on that day, and he believed it. Then I remember the professor, myself and my friend having a long conversation in this sort of tunnel like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2822,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:george details,10-28-2013,"2 M The characters involved were my mother, father, 16 or 17 year old brother Dave. It was an unusual dream. The feeling of communicating with my parents was distinctly important. It's sort of difficult to accurately describe the setting situation as far as feeling of the dream, one dream as being taken, no dream was taking place. The basic idea of the dream was I was traveling from someplace to home and when I got home, I was to clean something. There was a chore that was expected of me to do. The whole base of the dream was my coming from one point to home. The dream seemed to be more in the tense of the past. It just didn't have the characteristics of a present. My father particularly. In the past, well, it just seemed different. The house seemed to be across from our house where we lived in New Jersey. Very good friends of my mother and father lived there, and this seemed to be the house we were occupying. This dream seems to be fouled up by the same sort of feeling and situation of the first dream recorded tonight of a light plane landing, myself sitting, watching it. It seemed to be completely different from the dream about my folks. There seemed to be no relationship between the two. It was just as if one was cut off, and the next thing this one starts, but the bit with the plane wasn't as if a story or something. It was just this plane was landing and that was all there was to it. This was to be the end anyway. The blank referred to was known to me before reaching home and this was going thru my mind as I was traveling to my destination, and there was hardly any conversation between myself and my folks, just a salutation upon arrival and exchange of words. This was the extent of the dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2824,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:george details,10-28-2013,"16 S In the beginning of the dream I was eating a doughnut on an airplane. I was captain and it was either a DC 6 or a 4-engine plane or DC 3, which is a two-engine. The stewardess had just finished coming around with doughnuts. She was making the rounds to the different men on the plane. There was a total of about four men on the plane. The plane was on the ground and it wasn't up in the air. It was just sitting. And I had a captain's uniform on; however, the front was not buttoned and I was sitting in the pilot's seat which is on the right hand side as you stand facing the airplane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2825,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:erik details,10-28-2013,"10 S I dreamt that I was a newspaper staff member. Just what my function was at the newspaper, I don't remember. I was instrumental, I remember, in making up an advertisement and also making a layout for a big boat show that was coming to Miami. Also, alone these same lines, I dreamt that I went out to get pictures for the special edition about this boat show, and if I remember correctly, I went down to the Keys to get pictures, myself and one other person. And I took a picture of this other person fishing -- one picture was him -- fishing out in the ocean, and I was going to get another one of him fishing inland. At the end of the dream, I remember commenting about the direction the birds happen to be flying at the time. What significance it had, I don't know. I just remember making some comment about them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2826,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"10 R I can't remember much, but I do remember I was coming back from working or something, and I was driving down a hill very much like one we have back in Vermont. However, for some reason I thought I was in Florida. I remember just coming down the hill and I had gotten up to 60 miles an hour, and I was just pumping the brakes and slowed myself right down to about 40. I said, ""I'll just put it in second and keep it there."" So I shift into second and I guess I had a little trouble getting it in because I was looking at the shift anyway. When I looked up there was a parked car right in front of me, and I jammed on my brakes to avoid it and swerved, came around and then I just barely hit another parked car that was ahead of this first one I saw. This second one was about a '54 Plymouth and my right wheel or tire went into his left tire well, that is the front tire well. I didn't see that there was any damage done to the car, but I just put somebody else, a friend of mine, but one that I'm not familiar with, said that I had cracked the fender. I got out and took a look at this car and didn't think so because it had been in a hole and it was all cracks and dents. The first car that I swerved to avoid was a friend of mine. It was a red Valiant, and I remember the paint job got real bad on it. He had his name in magic marker on the window ledge on the driver's side. There was a bunch of phone numbers of girls. About the time I was noticing this, I got woke up by the alarm clock. The color of the car that I hit was sort of a light blue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2827,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"6 R I didn't have this dream immediately. It was a while back, and I'm not too clear on all the details, but I'll do as best I can. The dream took place on a farm I worked on last summer and the summer before. I think when it started I was driving my car around, that is the present car I own now. I remember parking it in the front yard. It had a lawn there and a stream, but they don't have one in actuality though. There were several other people working there. All of them my age. I can't place any of them right now. They seem to be some of my friends. I seem to know them all anyway. I was working out in the fields most of the day. After working for a few hours, I stopped and was doing something. I could have been working on the car. I'm not sure. At any rate, I wasn't working for the boss. Soon after this, it seemed everybody gathered in the front yard, and everybody was just fooling around, playing games as it were. I remember there was a very large, well like a weather balloon. They were kicking back and forth. I joined in this also. Then I waited on the sidelines with another friend of mine because I knew we shouldn't be doing this. We should be working. The boss came out then. He didn't seem too mad, but he wanted to know how to get everybody back to work. I just suggested that he say no pay unless you get back to work. He said it and everybody got back to work. I was just about to go to work then. I looked at my car and noticed it was all covered with sand. The hood was up. I looked around inside. I was afraid perhaps that somebody dropped sand down the carburetor or filled up the air cleaner with it. There was sand around there, but all the fittings were tight, so no sand could get into it. So I put the hood down and went back to work. Then the scene shifts to a room in the farm house and I was working on a term paper. This term paper was on the development of automobiles. On the European style vs. the American style. I can remember doing a report on these and taking pictures out of a booklet that I had then subjecting it to the farmer to read. For some reason I was passing it to him. Maybe it was just for approval. I'm not sure. At any rate, he liked it and the dream seemed to have ended there. I really can't interpret this too well. He seemed to be consistent or acted just the way he always does. I noticed that his children never appeared in the dream, and they were certainly always around the farm house when I was back there. As for colors I do remember vividly the grass was kind of green, and the big beach ball, weather balloon that we were kicking around was brown. It was very much like a basketball except it was rather large.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2828,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"8 R I was with a friend of mine, Jan, who came down here to the lab last night. I brought him down to take a look at it. I was out in my car and I was having trouble. I had to jack up the rear end of the car to change the tires. I guess I had to change two tires, both of them on one side. We also had along my roommate's scout, which is more or less like a jeep. I don't know how it came along or who was driving it. Anyways, it was there. I remember one thing, the car went into a ditch. I guess that was intentional because then we could tip the thing and get at the wheels. I didn't work out too well. I remember the scout was also in the ditch, and it was full of water. When I pulled back the matting on the bottom of the thing, I pulled out some drain plugs to let the water drain out. This is something that is not in the scout right now, and it fills with water every time it rains, and I keep telling my roommate that he should do it, put in these things, but evidently on this trip they were in there. We went to a farm house. And now it was the scout that seemed to be having the troubles and my car disappeared from the scene. I backed up onto an extremely steep ramp and there both rear wheels were exposed and we could do our work on them very easily. The farmer that came out just wondered what we were doing and we told him and he said, ""That's all right, go ahead."" I guess we finished whatever we had to do. Then I went and talked to the farmer. He was a young man about 25 or 27. He wasn't saying too much. I told him that I had worked on a farm and loved it. This didn't get much of a rise out of him though. Then I told him that I noted that he had Holstein cows. We thought a Holstein cow was the only way to legally water down milk. This made him split a gut, he was really laughing. He really thought this was funny. Just in the way of explanation, Holstein cows have a very low butter fat content in milk. In fact, it's lower than the minimum standard permitted by the state. We left the farm house and in the next scene I was alone in a very large house which was full of lamps and couches and all kinds of things. I guess I was an interior decorator's house. I remember in particular he had two small girls and they were playing near staircases and there was no railing around these and I kept wondering why they didn't fall. It didn't seem to bother him at all. There was a lack of protection for them. They never did fall. There was also something about me doing some work on my car there, and when I was through I remember I came back into the house and handed him back his shirt evidently which I had been wearing. I don't remember ever taking off mine. I just remember handing him back his. It was a sports shirt, cotton sport shirt. After I came out of the house. I drove off and had to come back. I remembered something. I can't remember what it was, but I ran over and saw his daughter. His daughter was sitting in a group with three other women and speaking German. I have had very little German and I couldn't do much in the way of conversation with her, but she spoke in English and said something. I went back to the house and got something and then left. The way I was going, however, I thought I knew the way back. It was an expressway, more or less. There was about a 45-mile speed limit, but I was doing much faster than this. I was unhappy because my car seemed rather sluggish. In fact, a motor scooter passed me. Well, this motor scooter, which was a Vespa with two guys on it, slowed down and they talked to a, the driver talked to a black and white '57 Chevy. Then the Chevy dropped back to me. In it was the daughter that I had just talked to. She said, ""I thought you knew your way back to the university."" And I said, ""So did I, but I guess I'm wrong."" She said, ""Well, continue on straight ahead."" When I got up there, I saw that I had just made a complete circle because there was a toll booth I had just gone through. When I got up there, she explained what had happened. I pulled a $20 bill out of my wallet and 2 guys in the toll booth both grabbed it and they both handed me back a $10 bill, slapped me on the back and said ok. I said, ""What happened,"" you know, because I got back all the money. He said, ""We're letting you go through free,"" or excuse me, an 8-year-old boy said that to me who was also in the toll booth. I guess one of them in there was his father. So I said, ""Great,"" but before I started out, another car came up and a guy asked me for change. I remember him handing me some, but I also remember him scraping his little finger through my wallet. I know he didn't get any bills, but I remember I thought he pulled out a 25 cent piece or something, but I had change all over the seat from something. I said, ""Oh, the heck with it,"" and drove on. I was on a large expressway and had the car up to 85. I was listening to WFUN, the Rick Farragen show, I guess it was, and he just won some contest and just about this point I woke up.

I was aboard this ship. I believe it was a Navy ship. We were going towards this island and once we got there, everybody that was on the island -- there were Navy men on the island and they were, they weren't doing much; they were just laying around, sitting around the island. Then two of them were going to give a demonstration of how the natives of this island used to have some type of a ritual, a sword fight or something. So two Navy men proceeded to go through the motions of a sword fight between two ancient warriors. And as the dream wore on, these Navy men turned into, or as the dream went on, these Navy men were actually these warriors, these very fierce Anglo-Saxon type of warriors with their long swords, what have you. They proceeded to fight, and they were really going at it. And one kept hitting against the other one's sword and backing him up, and backing him up ... Ha, ha, here's a clincher! The one that was being beaten by the sword fight told the one that was beating him, said, ""Wait a minute,"" and he walked away, and he said something to the effect that he had to do a milk commercial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2830,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"12 R The group of us had just heard something about Africa, a talk. We were thinking of going there. My grandfather had evidently been ____________________. He had some relations living with him at the time, but it seems as if one of them died. He was about a 75-year-old man. I found myself, plus a few other people, were going on a trip, but before we went, my mother wanted me to go over and ask my grandfather about the feasibility of our family going to Africa. We were in a 1955 Plymouth. So we went over there and I was appointed to ask him. When I first got in, he was busy talking with a doctor. The doctor, I guess, was just giving him a little examination and also talking about the glories of Africa. It also seems that the doctor was something like a vacuum cleaner salesman, but that's a little foggy, and I can't quite remember it. When the doctor finally got through talking to my grandfather, I asked him about Africa and taking my parents. He said a very emphatic no. He said my mother cold never live there. He said there were too many snakes. He said that you live net to a big zoo because they had caged animals, but he said the only way you could live down there was to shoot and kill the food, and he didn't think my mother would ever get along. I went back to the car. It seems as if my mother had gone on to a camp we were staying at and the car had come back and it had 2 other guys and myself so that there were 3 in all, but we drove a ways and then we came to a large zoo, just like the one my grandfather described in Africa. It almost seems as if we were in Africa. We looked around there for a while, and then there were 3 African people who came up to the car and wondered if we were going back to camp. We said we were, so they asked for a ride. The car started back for camp, and I remember we were all rather tired as it had been a long trip. The guys said to stop at the next bar and get a drink. I was a little worried because I knew my mother wouldn't like it if she smelled it, and also we had one guy that I was sure was under 21. Now for this scene it seemed to be sort of in the United States because there were tobacco fields and the billboards were in English. There was one lipstick billboard and therefore red lips on the girl. Just about this time the alarm went off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2831,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:george details,10-28-2013,"1 M An overall underlying feeling of the dream was something to the effect of everything was moving along smoothly in the sense that, I mean, the action was just coming piece after piece. It was just a smooth falling setting in action. Then there seems to be no reason at all the action tries to go backwards and there's this conflict like a smooth circle and then this pulling back or sort of down. It's a very difficult image to explain, but in the dream action moves along smoothly and then one character started pulling or struggling with another and this is what created the feeling of pulling down and backwards. At first it was just a matter of a struggle and then I saw myself in that struggle. As the dream became more clear, it seemed to be at an airport, and many people. There's just a disruption in the even flow of traffic or movement of a crowd, but I couldn't tell exactly who the struggle was with, just a disruption in the flow of activity. At the beginning of the struggle it was like trying to force the victim underneath water such as like a drowning. Keep someone's head under or something like this, and there was a lot of movement as far as resistance fighting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2832,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:ed details,10-28-2013,"11 R The earliest thing I can remember was coming on to an old farm which looked as if it had all been closed down. It was located in Vermont, supposedly in the center of the state. The dream for some reason seems to be taking place in the past. I looked around the farm for a while and then went to the edge of a steep bank. There's a file? built near the bank and I looked over the bank and there were 3 large sailboats. Two of them had 3 masts and one of them had 2. They were, one was way over a 100 ft. The smallest was about 50 ft. I was looking at these, I remember, and I noticed a penny just down over this bank. I reached down to get it and it was a 1916 penny in perfect condition, just like it had come right out of the mint, and I thought, ""Oh boy, here's a valuable penny,"" so I picked it up and put it in my pocket. Then as I was standing there, it seemed as if I dropped a camera that I had with me. Excuse me it was an exposure meter, and this broke and as I was picking up the pieces 2 men came around the trail. I saw them long before they saw me, but I realized there was no way I could get away from them without them seeing me, so I just stood there. They were a little surprised and asked me if I had permission to be on the property and I said no, I was just interested in the place, and they didn't seem to be too mad. Then they asked me if I had a key to the barn. I said, ""No, I don't know what you're talking about."" He said, ""Well, come on in."" He opened the door and it was just filled with camera equipment. We were, I guess, on the 2nd story. ""Remember,"" I said, ""this barn was built back into the hill, and so in other words you entered about in the center of the barn."" There was a man taking some pictures in a studio, which was down below us and then it was like one big camera shop for the rest of the place. I was just walking through. I was amazed at all the cameras that were there. They were for the most part Japanese makes. I can't remember much which one now. It was a familiar one to me. I remember I walked over to a bin of used cameras and I noticed an old Polaroid camera, but it was made by Ansco, which doesn't make Polaroid cameras. This really surprised me and I looked over it for a long time. The thing was so rotten, I doubt if it would take pictures. I told him I couldn't afford anything right then, but I was interested in seeing some of his prices. He showed me a catalogue and he picked out one item which I had, which was a telephoto lens and he said he could get it for me for $25. I paid about $32 for it, so it was a pretty good price. Then I decided I would have to leave and as I went out the door, I was bending over looking around the steps for some parts to my exposure meter, which I hadn't picked up, and I found them all and then I went to my car and I went back home. Now there was a lot more to this dream that had to do with what happened back home with the car. I just can't remember it, though. I do remember one other scene in the camera store, though. A boy about 15 came in with a camera that he wanted fixed. It was just a simple box camera, and the guy said he would do it for $2,and the whole bottom was broken out of it. I was rather surprised they cold do it for this price. He did. Then another boy came in and bought a rather expensive 35 mm. camera. For some reason this property, instead of being just a farm, was the estate of a very rich man who had died, and the property was just no longer in use. As I mentioned, the boats were there, and they seemed to belong to him. They had some symbolism or something like that of a manufacturing empire. It seemed to be textiles, though I didn't see a textile mill around. Vermont used to have a lot of textile mills and a lot of them are closed down in many of the towns. I remember wondering where there was a lake big enough to sail about 200 ft. long, as long as the big one probably was. I guess that's about all I can recall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2833,,,,,,ID: miami_lab:george details,10-28-2013,"9 M The setting of the dream looked into the past by way of a photograph album. I was looking at some photographs of a certain type of water rescue and I was rescuing the instructor, who was a big sort of Phil Silvers-looking type of guy, just a little bit bigger and broader and so forth. I had a little cap. I was laying on the side of the pool, and I'm supposed to be trying to help him up, but it looked more like they were helping me and it was supposedly a series of four, four shots in succession of me as a younger kid. However, they eventually turned out to be moving pictures. There was another group of pictures of a girl doing the same thing I was doing. It was sort of like an, not an advertisement, but an example of how other people can use this type of rescue. There was no purpose of the rescue. It wasn't being used by the Red Cross or a standardized job; there was no real point to it. As I was viewing this, I was looking at myself and was just noting muscle structure of my body, trying to get a picture of what I supposedly look like to others when younger. However, at this closer look, I seemed to all of a sudden just become my usual size again. The first original snapshot appeared to be myself very young with a hat, baseball hat, just to give a significance of youth. Then the movie of the pictures I seem to enlarge. This dream is what just appeared to be the tail end of another dream. However, my recall for the other, longer dream is not very good at all. In fact, I remember, that's just not clear right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I remember coming into the port on a muddy dirt road. We were all walking and as we came into the port, we saw lots of ships, most of which were damaged and battle worn. I remember seeing a few sailors around working. We finally boarded what looked like a barge with a top on it, that had benches extending down either side of it.

It was an exhilarating feeling. I felt very pleased with its occurrence. I only came in on a wave once.

The shoes belonged to my aunt's boy who is brain damaged. I thought this was a dirty trick and was quite angry at the students for doing this childish act. I climbed up on the roof to get the shoes and threw them down to the ground. Before I could get down , the group of students started throwing rocks up at me from all sides. I crouched in the center of the roof and none of the rocks hit me directly. Then they decided to come up and get me. I punched the first one up the ladder off the roof. A few more came at me and I knocked them all off the roof. The rest left me alone. Then the scene changed and I was in a bar with a small, raised wooden stage. A stranger asked me if I wanted to fight, and I said ok. So we fought (boxed) on the stage and I beat him. Then another wanted to fight and I beat him also. Then still another and I beat him.

It was about a 1950 or 1952 Chevrolet wit a couple in it, husband and wife. People I've never seen before, about 35 years old. The car was burning up because the radiator didn't have water in it, so I remember I -- as is the case in gas stations, you open the hood and you very carefully loosen the radiator cap and elt the steam begin to escape. While I was doing this, the boss, for example, came over. He was talking to the couple. He asked what kidn of car is the best, if they wanted to buy a new one. I remember the wife and husband were kind of, well, it was something to the effect that the wife wanted to get a new car so she was kind of hinting to my boss and said that the new cars were very good and so forth and that they should buy one. Anyway, I remember the boss said that he wasn't too sure about these new cars because with the new range of mechanics that were coming out, they could fix up a Ford very well. They could fix up any other kind of car very well. Then he wasn't too sure which was the best. As I said, while this was going on, I had finally gotten the radiator cap off and the car was steaming quite a bit. I kept putting water in the radiator. I told them to let the engine idle as you should. Then very naturally as you're supposed to do in this dream, I also brought the hose inside the car and was watering off the dashboard.

He was showing me a notebook. The notebook was filled with the names of certain male, only male relatives he pointed out of my girlfriend, cousins and uncles and so on. There were about 25 names in the book, and he pointed out to me that the ones that had x's over their names, that had made x marks after they had signed their names and addresses in the book, were the ones that didn't believe in God. Oh, and I think I remember that almost all of the names were Lesnik, that was their last name, different first names, but their last names were all or nearly all Lesnik. About 5 or 6 of the 25 didn't believe in God, and I remember being at the time very surprised that this didn't shock the father. He wasn't upset by it at all.

I was visiting at the house of two friends of mine, a married couple, both of whom go to the University of Miami. I was relaxing in their living room when another couple who lives behind this couple walked in. Of the second couple, the wife is very attractive and has a magnificent figure. I was thinking on this occasion as I have in real life, whether the husband was very adequate to the wife. The wife said she might like to go out and take a walk. It was raining slightly, so I said something to the effect that it was only drizzling very slightly and it might be nice to take a walk out there in the rain. So she walked out, started walking down the block, and then I came out to follow her. The neighborhood wasn't exactly like any neighborhood I've ever seen. It was somewhat similar to the terrain in San Francisco. The houses were up on sloping hills and she walked down to a house on the corner and sat on the grass on one of these slopes. I ran on the top of the slope and then ran down the slope and sat beside her. At this point when I reached her, she was no longer the wife of this guy. She was no longer the same girl, but she was Oriental. She had an Oriental face, which didn't surprise me somehow. She began talking in that inscrutable way of Orientals, with a little proverb, something about the fact that I would go very far in life, because I was good at business deals. For example, if I wanted to make a good deal on my brother's car (by the way, I have no brother and in the dream at the time I realized I didn't have a brother, yet it wasn't completely shocking to me). I sort of knew that this was an example, that she didn't really think I had a brother, but anyway if I sold my brother's car, I could sell half-interest in it for $200 plus ten dollars for title fee, and thus I would make an amazing profit. Somehow at the time I understood. That's the end of that dream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told her to drop me off at a place where I could get it fixed, because I had to be someplace at a certain time (I can't recall where now), but she didn't drop me off. She went grocery shopping and I had to stay with her because the bike had a flat. I remember waiting in the car while she shopped. I was very angry because she didn't drop me off to get my bike fixed, and I thought that I was going to be late to where I was going. Finally she dropped me off at what looked like a large, open parking lot with grass on it. It reminded me of the parking lot at Miami Stadium. That is the last I recall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2853,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:george details,10-28-2013,"11 The setting was a golf course. Someone whom I couldn't recognize gave me a tee and a ball. As I was about to tee off; the tee was where I put it in a yard close by. I went in to get it. The yard transformed into a rough lake and the tee became long and I think like a cane. I was determined to retrieve the tee. Someone shouted it was a snake. I was being thrown around on the waves like a buoy. The next thing I was being chased by the snake towards shore. I had almost reached shore when it bit me on the ankle. I then started to try to kill the snake. I first grabbed a Budweiser beer bottle and smashed the snake over the head. The bottle didn't break and the snake was still alive. I then had a big shoe brush in my hand. It split in a quarter and finally killed it. Meanwhile there was pain in my foot, real pain that I felt physically. My mother now is there. I told her I got bit and it's too late, that the snake was poisonous and I'm going to die. This is all that was recalled of the dream. [fear, frustration, perplexed, unpleasant]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2854,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:mac details,10-28-2013,"14 In this dream I remember going to downtown Miami in a car. My father and another man were with me. I recall that we got downtown and parked the car at the garage where I work. We even went with the car up in the elevator. My father asked the attendant if the car would be safe, and the attendant replied that a triple lock would be used. This seemed to satisfy my father. I also recall telling the attendant that I worked at the garage part time. Then the three of us went down to the street. We were going to go eat and then watch a parade that was scheduled. It seemed to be the New Year's Eve parade, but this time it was held during the daytime. I remember that my father didn't like the restaurant that we decided to eat at and he wanted to go back and get the car and go someplace else to eat. This made me mad and I told him he could do that if he wanted to, but that I was going to eat and then watch the parade. The three of us split up and then I remember walking down Biscayne Blvd. South toward the curve in the road. This seemed to be after I had eaten. I remember seeing the Vanguards Drum and Bugle sitting in a very grassy area. I recall very vividly their red satin blouses and the bells of their instruments shining in the sun. I recall asking one of them if they were going to lead the parade and he said no, they were not. This is the last that I recall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2855,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:sam details,10-28-2013,"3 I was in this drugstore (more like a small general store with a lunch counter) and I walked through to the back of the store where I played a gambling device with Joe Hill (one of my classmates). We each choose a marker (black or white) and when the machine was turned on the markers would travel through a maze at the end of the maze was a straight stretch into a cup and the first marker into the cup won. The machine randomly changed the coefficient of friction of the markers so that one would slide faster than the others. The marker I chose was fastest through the maze, but lost right at the very end. Then the scene changed and I was with a mixed group of boys and girls. They were pairing off (boy with girl) and soon I was standing alone with Phyllis (a girl in my class) in a room which had four rooms opening into it (one from each side) and where each couple occupied one room. I looked around and Phyllis was the only one left and the one I least desired to sleep with. She was lying down on a bed with her arms outstretched to me. I took off my clothes and with a mental shrug of indifference lay down beside her. She embraced me and her body was warm and soft -- more pleasing than I had anticipated. Then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2856,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:sam details,10-28-2013,"7 (Observation) The scene was inside a gymnasium and there were a bunch of basketball players sitting along the wall on a bench, and the coach went up and told one of the basketball players that he was fired. The basketball player wanted to know why he was fired, and the coach said because he was a dope addict and he knew it. The player was going to show the coach he was still good for beating him up. Except when he fought, the player couldn't hurt the coach. Coach laughed and said, ""If that's the best you can do, you'd better leave."" The coach had told him to go to 42nd St. and 42nd St. (which I realized didn't exist). This precipitated the fight also. And he left and went to a drug store and the stools were full at the counter, so he just kind of walked through. Then he was walking down the street, having gone through the back door. The street numbers were real screwy -- driving one block the numbers would change 100 (for instance, from 49 to 160 in one block). I didn't see him anymore. (Participation) We were down on a dock and he came walking there, and his face was all bloody. I asked him why and he said he wrecked his car, and I knew he didn't have a car, so he must have stolen one (didn't observe this aloud). Asked if no one else was hurt. Said no. Then we got on a little boat with a captain. Funny way of getting on boat -- had 2 perpendicular rails to ground in doorway of boat. They got closer to door frame. You had to wedge your feet on either side, hold on with your hands, disengage foot and step through. Boat ride costs $40. We were on these little things like surfboards, lying down and going down a waterway with little waves a few inches high. Captain said, ""Make sure you keep the tip end of board over little ridge of water or else you'll sink."" Went further -- then said reason for using these shallow boards is there is a sunken ship beneath us. If you put your arm down in water, you can feel it. I felt it -- covered with layer of soft touch muck. (No feelings about it.) First I felt he door on sunken boat, opened it and tried to reach down into, but couldn't feel anything. (Boards we're riding must have stopped.) Went a little further on rafts. Reached down and felt a soft bottom. When we got to shore, I went home. Mother-in-law wanted to know why I hadn't cleaned the yard, and I told her I spent all day yesterday cleaning it up and the kids had messed it up again. She said, ""That's impossible,"" and I said, ""Ask Diane (my wife)."" She said, ""Yes he did, but one of the kids was rolling through a pile of pine needles and had spread it all over the yard."" I told her I wasn't going to do it again, and we left.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2857,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:sam details,10-28-2013,"9 My wife and I were living in an apartment, the bedroom of which opened out to a courtyard on the other side of a small store fence which surrounded the courtyard. A teacher (professor) gave lectures to his class. He (the teacher) could see into our bedroom and it appeared that he spent more time looking into our bedroom than at his class. My wife complained about this. We were both in the same bed, and I looked up and he was watching us. So I went out into the courtyard and told him to mind his own business (words were exchanged and I got the best of him verbally, although I can't remember the exact argument). Later a girl in a yellow dress told me that this same professor said I was sleeping with a woman other than my wife. He said that is what he saw. I went out in the courtyard again, but the class he was teaching went into an uproar and laughed at me. I went back into the house and into my desk and got my .22 automatic and walked out with it under my shirt. The students gathered around when they saw I had a gun under my shirt. So I took the gun out and held it in the open. I was walking down a cobblestone street looking for the professor. The students (boys and girls my age dressed in many colors) tried to dissuade me. They got close and I fired a shot at their feet. The shot was weak, more like a b-b gun than a .22. someone mentioned this fact in the crowd, so I fired a few more times and the .22 acted more like a .22 than a b-b gun. I found the teacher walking down the street with two of his friends (both rude, all of them older than myself). I fired a shot in front of him and was going to fire another shot, but I realized I was out of ammunition. (The gun clicked empty.) So I tried a bluff. I went over to him and told him to take back the lie about my sleeping with someone other than my wife. He refused. I gave him the count of ten to change his mind. He refused and closed his eyes. I counted down from 10-9-8-7-6-5. At the count of ______ or between 3 and 4, I placed the barrel of the gun against his forehead. He was visibly shaken. At the count of 2, he said he would change his story and then said he couldn't really tell who was sleeping with me. With a little further argument, he said it must have been my wife. Then the alarm went off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2858,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"4 The time is winter and a group of students and myself are on a field trip. The instructor is telling us about the formation of sand dunes and snow drifts as we walk through the snow. We all have a drawing board and are making a drawing of the areas he tells us about. The lecture then seems to get more artistic than scientific as the beauty of the drifts, trees and few buildings is pointed out. I remember I was making my drawing with a Bic pen just like the one I am using on this report. I tried to show the way the snow looked as it formed little clouds at the lips of the snow banks as it blew. The ones we were seeing were in beautiful pastels of red, green, and blue. The instructor also pointed out the beauty of the noise of the wind. I made a slight whistle, which sounded much like it and someone else did the same. Just before I awakened, the instructor told us about a canoe that was awarded to the student at Yale who could make the best academic recovery and hold it for a month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2859,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"6 I was in a co-ed boarding school or college by the edge of the sea. Many of the classes were outside. I remember one in which about 50 of us were all on one big rock next to the water. I cannot remember the subject of the class, however. We had some classes inside also. In one, I remember, I had an assignment to deliver a short talk on the value of the education I was getting at the school and how it differed from other schools. I did a very poor job preparing, but I was sure I would not be called. As it turned out the professor (female) stopped just one person before me. For this class we were in a large room somewhat like a cafeteria. In the corner I was sitting in there were some strange foods which had just been brought in for dinner. I remember one was mastodon meat. After that class we had one outside on the rocks. I left early and did not clean up the things I was working with, but someone else did it for me. After this I remember being tired and wanting to lie down on one of the ceremonial couches, but I didn't. Two girls were lying on these, however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2860,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:cain details,10-28-2013,"12 I was climbing down a very steep mountain with a girl whom I don't know and going to see some friends of ours in a jail, apparently during a war or something. While walking along this narrow path, I told the girl to watch out because there was a quicksand pit up ahead. We walked around that, and then when we went a little further, there was this 6 ft. wall on the left, and it had bars like the bars of a cell. There was warm lava coming down the mountain and in order to keep from falling down, we grabbed onto these bars and started going hand over hand to this jail cell. When we got to it, I climbed down to the window that was guarded by bars and I felt kind of guilty because I wasn't in there with them, and I asked if there was anything I can get for them since I was outside. One guy wanted a bottle of wine and told me the exact name of the wine and I remember writing the name on the wall next to the barred up window. Then I retreated from the window and found myself in a 4-walled one-story building with only part of a roof. While walking out of this building I saw some men running at me who were part of an army or something. They were running at me with machine guns because I had been talking with the prisoners. They were shooting the guns. I had a bottle of wine on me for this man, but I don't know where I got it from. The wine turned into a pint bottle of Vodka. I know Vodka was combustible, so I threw it out the window of this 4-walled structure and I figured that the army would keep firing at it with their bullets and it would catch on fire, and it did. It got on fire that which spilled out of the bottle, but the bottle itself didn't catch on fire. One of the men reached over and grabbed the bottle and threw it back into this four-walled structure where I was. Figuring it would go off, I ran outside and found myself in the company of this beautiful young German blond. Apparently she was a ballet dancer or a girl who was interested in gymnastics or something. She was very graceful in her movements and she was showing me certain movements and certain steps and said she could show me these steps better if we would go inside the gym. There was a half-constructed gym, it still had sanded floors and wooded beams supporting the interior of it. We went in and she started showing me these graceful movements and what not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2861,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"2 I remember driving up a hill on a paved road. It was a steep hill, probably in Maine. The road made a right hand turn, but I kept right on going in the same direction I was going. I was going up a trail that was very steep. I kept right on going till I reached the top of this hill. There was no road up there, just a trail and a lot of rocks. I felt rather foolish driving all the way up, and I came back down. Then the setting changes. It was flat-seeming like Florida is. Then I stopped to see one of my customers, but this is no customer that I recognized. As I saw she was just a customer, I never even got out of the car. She just came to the car window and I rolled it down to talk to her. She was a woman about 45 and had brown hair. I don't remember the conversation. It was pleasant, though. It only lasted a few minutes. I drove on and that's about all I can remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2862,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:cain details,10-28-2013,"11 I was in a cabin someplace where it was snowing with this girl from the Hot Shops [a restaurant in S. Miami]. We were married but we didn't agree to this marriage. We were just kind of thrown into it.

I didn't actually recognize the area, but I remember hearing two people talking about how long it had been since they had been to the Castaways docks. We were standing there looking into the water when this gentleman and this young lady came up and they were the ones who mentioned that it had been such a long time since they had been down there to the Castaways and seen the water and the boats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2864,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"17 This dream was about a series of things which went on while I was at home in Vermont. The time was in the present, and I had just come home. The first thing I can remember was coming out of a neighbor's house. In the house I vaguely remember talking with a group of people--who I think I knew. I then got an old piano stool and began to ride it down a small hill. After a few trips down I got tired of this and looked over to another neighbor's house. In his yard there was an old racing car. I then took the piano stool, which had somehow changed into something else on four wheels, and tossed it into the pile of antiques I had taken it from. I thought I might have bent one of the wheels, but I didn't take a closer look. I went to this second neighbor's basement (which was open--much like a garage--however, not in actuality) and started looking around then at antiques. There were about three cars there and boxes of other things. I picked up a slot machine which had been used to figure out income tax. It worked this way. You pull the handle to spin the dials. Whatever numbers came up is the amount you pay--unless you hit the jackpot, then you get money. (Wow!) I remember this thing was light and looked as if it had been made in Japan from tin cans. After looking at a few more things, I left. I went home because we were supposed to go with my father to see about getting a new Jeep or Land Rover. My brother was shaving when I reached the bathroom. After he finished, he told me that he had been down to see the Jeep dealer and found that Dad could get a Jeep fully equipped with all the accessories he wanted for the price of the bare land Rover. I told my brother that this wouldn't work on Dad. He had his mind made up on a Rover and it would be almost impossible to change. He agreed with me. I then came into the bathroom as he was finished shaving. I noticed that the toothpaste tube was floating in the toilet bowl. My brother said it had slipped off the sink. My brother then began talking about changing because he wanted to wear an undershirt under the shirt he had on if he was going to see this Jeep dealer. I told him that was foolish. In Florida few students wear them because of the heat. I then remember thinking that it was probably 95 degrees in Miami and clear (it was cloudy and cool at home). He agreed with me, but then looked and found he was wearing one anyway. I then remember cleaning a large plastic tube about _"" in diameter and 10' long. The part I was cleaning was a fitting on one end. It seems somehow that this was part of the razor, but I am not sure. I got a lot of water on the floor from cleaning it as it ran through the tube. I then began to talk to my brother more about the Jeep deal. I said that surely the dealer could offer the price he did for the outfitted Jeep--all he would have to do is to take the stuff off the old Jeep and put it on the new one. The same thing could be done with the Rover. I cannot remember much beyond this. The last scene in my mind before I woke up was something about a hired girl we have living with us and some bunnies she had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2865,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"3 In the beginning of this dream I was in the back of a large, open truck with a bunch of other boys. It seems that we were going back to school. I cannot remember what we were talking about. We stopped at the edge of a small town and everyone was getting out to go swimming. I threw down the helmet to my skin diving wet suit and said, ""Five dollars."" Immediately a boy took it and gave me the $5, which was for renting it). The place we swam at was much like a place we used to go to in Colorado when I was in summer camp. It was a gorge full of deep pools and a lot of fast-moving water. The boy I rented the helmet to was in the place I wanted to go but it was so small, only I could fit. Finally he moved out and I got in. I had my mask on so I was doing some diving. I remember thinking I could really earn a lot if I rented out my whole suit. The dream becomes hazy now, but I do remember something about a red and white '57 Ford going up the road. It had a N.Y. plate on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2866,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:cain details,10-28-2013,"10 I was with this girl that I used to know down at the yacht club that we go to and we were sitting o the white sands of a lake in our bathing suits watching a ski show. One skier was skiing stand up. It was trick skiing. He was standing up on top of a motorcycle. He was holding the line and skiing on top of this motorcycle. When he jumped off, they had a line to the motorcycle and I thought to myself, ""The motorcycle is going to sink,"" but the line started pulling the motorcycle in and the boat started to slow down and the motorcycle was pulled into this separate compartment in the boat as soon as the boat stopped and therefore the cycle didn't sink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2867,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"13 The first thing I remember was having difficulty here at college with my studies. I couldn't seem to get the right courses. A small co-ed boarding school then offered to take me and I accepted. The school was located in a large house right by my home in Vermont, and it was winter. My present roommate Tom also came with me. We first met the headmaster and then Tom met a girl he really liked. He talked to her for a while, then we went to our room. There we met another girl--one I went after. My only problem was that I fell asleep talking to her. Tom, however, kept the conversation going. At first I thought he was going to try to take her, but he said he wasn't interested. He still liked the first girl he met best. It almost seems that the rest of the dream was during the next day, Sunday, I think. The first thing that I remember was a boy standing outside my door looking out of a window. He was wondering how to get out of the building without being caught. Tom and I told him to jump out the window (3rd story). That didn't really help him much. We then started talking about the girls. Tom reminded me that I was class #12. He said all I had to do was find out the girls in #11 and I could get any one of them for the date at the end of the day. I went downstairs to find out who was in my classes, but couldn't find the list. I then decided to go outside. At the door there were several boxes of fruit. I said at first that they were a product of Florida, but someone behind me said that they were from Canada. They turned out to be yellow melons which were a little frozen from standing out in the cold. When I went out, the first thing that happened was a tennis ball landed right near me. Even though it was snowing and there was a strong wind, there was a doubles match going on. I threw the ball back, but it didn't go too far. The guys on the court were mad at this, but I just said that I couldn't throw anything with the mittens I had on. The boy who was doing all the talking was one I had known from prep school and he wouldn't accept my reason. The ball came out again and this time I took off my mittens and threw the ball right over the court to show him I could do it. I decided to go home (which was just a stone's throw from the school). Before I left, however, I remember watching some of the boys from the school playing. They were aged from about seven to ten. At home I asked my father what he was going to do. He said he had just got a phone call from one of his friends who opened up a club I belong to. The club is way out in the country and surrounded by some beautiful scenery. My father's friend said that since my father hadn't showed up, he had closed the club. I looked at my watch then and found it was 11:40. I couldn't figure out why dad couldn't have gone earlier. I then remember thinking about the club. I knew it would be cold, etc., but I still would have loved to have gone there. The dream ends here. All through this dream I kept wondering why I had come to the school. I was by far the oldest student. I also wondered what my record was going to look like to an employer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2868,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:cain details,10-28-2013,"17 I dreamed I was in a little town someplace waiting, with two friends (one whom I recognized and one whom I didn't), for a train. Finally when the rain came by, it was moving very slowly just before it stopped and we started running along with it to get on it so we could look for someone. As these two buddies of mine were slowly running beside the train, I noticed that the track parallel to the train that they just jumped over was also moving at the same slow speed as the train so I thought to myself why run if I could ride, and I jumped up on the track. I was keeping up with my buddies, who were still running, when I decided to get off the moving track and run with them. Just before the train stopped, my buddies got on the engine instead of a passenger car and I yelled to them something like, ""No, you're getting on the wrong car."" But they had already climbed aboard and I went running towards the other end of the train (looking for a passenger car) while dodging colored porters pushing luggage carts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2869,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:cain details,10-28-2013,"5 I dreamed that I went to a cafeteria in a small town that served all you can eat for 99 cents. The funny part about it was that the cafeteria was on a plane of about a 45 degree angle. Apparently an earthquake had come through a couple of weeks before and left the cafeteria on an incline plane. As you walk in the door, the floor of the cafeteria was on an incline plane, not the whole town, just the cafeteria. As you walk in, the place where you pick up your food was in the shape of a square. You had to walk around a square-shaped counter pick your food, what you wanted, and place them in your plate. The first time around I didn't get all the food I wanted and I got up again to get some of the things that I apparently didn't see the first time around, such as dessert and stuff. On the next time around, I saw some rice and I picked it off the second shelf above head level, and I picked it off the shelf and tried to hold it level with the ground level outside. I apparently spilled it all over my head, and I was very mad. Before I took the second trip around, picked up my food and spilled the rice on my head, I almost got into a fight with someone who I remember from childhood, apparently over something he said that I didn't like. I saw other people in the cafeteria, but I didn't recognize them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2870,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"14 This dream takes place in a small town. As near as I can remember, almost he whole town was working toward one cause while the authorities were against them. It seems as if there had been a crime committed and the townspeople were protecting the crooks. Investigators were everywhere and it was my job to guide them around. Several times the underground would act to prevent the authorities from doing anything--like when they were after someone, an empty street was suddenly at the snap of a souie key man's finger, transformed into a maze of blockades, signs and parked cars. Usually there was one car that the investigator was pushed into. He was then driven off to be enlightened by someone, but there was no violence--in fact, it was funny. The scene now shifts. I am in a high priced European car (a black Mercedes, I think) with a sun roof. The car seems to be mine, and so does the house I stop at. A girl is there and apparently I am very fond of her. I cannot remember anything we did, however. Just vaguely I remember getting her a drink--champagne, I think. The scene now shifts again. The girl and I are listening to a radio. We seem older, perhaps married. The announcer is informing us that the country's #1 criminal has died beneath the wheels of a train. I remember that the year was 1939. Now the scene shifts again, this time to a 1939 car. I am thinking how remarkable it would be if the people of that year could see a 1964 car. The whole dream took place at night and the setting was, except for the last scene, was in Europe. I was often among very rich people and was, I guess, rich myself. The people in the dream were almost all older than I--average age was 30.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2871,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"12 In the first part of this dream, I had a date with a Negro girl, along with two other guys. It seems we were doing something for the civil rights movement. My date, I remember, had long, dark brown hair. We passed one movie house playing ""El Cid"" (I haven't seen it) and went to another one playing something like El Al-Solero. We decided to go to a different theater, however, because we didn't like the looks of the movie much. The next thing I remember was something about a war on cigars by the Europeans. It seems that they liked being able to travel with lower air fares, but that they didn't like cigar smokers on the planes. I guess I read this. Then I remember looking through a magazine and seeing an advertisement for a bicycle. To qualify, one had to take a test, which was sponsored by the Boy Scouts. They said to only write in if you thought you were #1. There would be more than one winner in NYC area and other cities. The last part of the dream involved a song by Ricky Nelson. In it, he was trying to get a girl who seemed to be his sister to leave a wild party ""gang-bang."" I remember him singing. The singing and music were good and I thought that it would do well because it would appeal to all girls who wished they had an older brother to protect them. Then the song went on and Ricky, still singing, got involved in a fight with this girl's date. Ricky, however, seemed to be enjoying it and baiting the guy on. He was doing this as I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2872,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"16 My roommate, Bill, and I went to Ft. Lauderdale at night. When we got there, we stopped at a sporting goods store. My roommate was so tired that he lay down on a sleeping bag that was on demonstration. The manager of the store came over and said he could sleep in it if he wanted--it would be great advertising. So he got some of his clothes off and went to sleep. Bill left the store and went out to the beach. Soon my roommate and I followed. There was a fat man of about 60 watching Bill and a girl he had picked up as they were in the water. He told us about a better beach that didn't have currents like the one we were at. The scene now changes and it is daytime and I am on a small motorcycle. I was going to where there was a big crowd and I was thinking something about the gear ratios he had in comparison to those in the cycle. The crowd was gathered around a fight ring. Some boys I knew from prep school were going to fight next--even though they were outclassed. After the fight (I cannot remember it or the outcome) we went to the house of a man and his wife (about 30) for coffee. I think he was a professor, perhaps for prep school.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2873,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:ed details,10-28-2013,"15 This dream started in the prep school I used to go to. It was Sunday evening and everyone was getting ready for a vespers service. I cannot remember just what I was doing. It could have been photographing the service, but anyway, I was up in front of the congregation. The man who was leading the service (it hadn't begun) said he wanted one more person in the choir. He pointed at me. I had to share a book with two other boys, and I didn't sing bad at all. I even remember the man who sent me up smiling at me as if to say, ""That's good."" The choir then filed out and went into another room. There was another organ in there, and the director began to have us rehearse. He then announced that we would not be needed for the rest of the service (which was going on in the next room) and we could go. I can then remember a few images of a rather dreary, dull dorm and my room. The scene then changes and goes back to the room we were rehearsing in. A few of us are telling about some injustice which has been done to us. The group splits into two opinions over the matter and tempers flair. It seemed to have something to do with the lights. The group I am in decides we must get to a control room to do something to the lights. We then start running down a long tunnel, but have to fight our way along it because the other group is trying to stop us at all costs. The tunnel was large enough to stand up in and in our point there was a stream running through it. I got the idea that I might be able to carry out the mission if I could run ahead and then unscrew all the light bulbs. I did this and it worked. The tunnel ended in my grandfather's basement. I rushed over to a large switch box with one other boy and we tried to figure which switch it was that controlled all the lights in the school. Finally I just began pushing buttons, but I got the one which opened the garage door. I quickly pushed the next button which closed it, but I was sure it had made enough noise to wake up my grandfather. And I was right because soon I heard some noise upstairs. I remember I took a whole flight of stairs in one leap, got my friend and started for the tunnel. But it was too late. My grandfather was coming down the stairs 4 at a time so I saw I had to speak to him. We explained we weren't trying to steal anything, but just had to do something to the lights. He accepted this. About this time the others all started coming out of the tunnel. One good friend said that I had a good idea when I unscrewed the lights, but that it was a little painful--he was rubbing a bump on his head. Finally, everything turned out fine and we all returned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2874,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:bart details,10-28-2013,"2 I was in Canada at our summer home. I was riding a bicycle through the mountain roads to Montreal, which was about 60 miles away. When I began riding, all was fine, but I came to a steep hill and I had a hard time to ride to the top. I had to get off my bicycle and walk. At the top of the hill were some people and a big dog, a German shepherd. I had a towel in one hand throughout the dream. I couldn't find my wallet because my back pocket was ripped off. I finally found my wallet, which was in the cuff of my pants. I remained on top of the hill and the people and the dog were gone. I began to keep riding, but then my bicycle fell apart, and the pieces looked like a broken lawn chair with pieces of aluminum, bars, wheels all over the ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2875,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:bart details,10-28-2013,"8 The first dream was when I was in an airplane with my brother (year older) and my girl. It was a small, one-engine plane. We landed and I got out. My brother and my girl wanted to see how high the plane would go. I could hear him talking to the tower and the man in the tower said that he could only fly as high as 11,000 feet. The runway on which I was standing was constantly smoldering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2876,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:bart details,10-28-2013,"10 The third dream was about my girl and Barry College. I went to see a play at Barry College. The play was about 4 acrobats. After the play, we went out to the cars and it was raining. When I turned around there was no one there. My girl and all the other people were inside, evidently the play was not over yet, so I waited outside. I was quite mad. When my girl came out, she had two of her girlfriends with her. They both wore yellow dresses and they were wet. We all got in my girl's car. It was a 1964 yellow 4-door Cadillac. After I was just getting ready to drive off with the three girls, my girl suggested that I let her girlfriend drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2877,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:bart details,10-28-2013,"14 I was on a journey, and I didn't know where I was going, but I was. I started to walk down this road which was a dirt road, and I began to walk and as I began walking, I saw different sights around every turn. The distance that I walked was approximately 50 miles, but the time factor involved was, it only took me about 15 minutes to walk that distance. I was walking at a normal pace but in the dream it only took me 15 minutes to reach approximately 50 miles. Anyway, I began walking and I walked over sort of a causeway, and on the left hand side there was a motel with a swimming pool. I didn't stop at any of these places. I just walked by them and I kept walking and around the next bend, it was like there was water on one side. On the other side. I can't remember what there was. At the next bend there was like a motel with a few boats and a dock and this big giant about 10 feet tall was there. He just looked like a normal man only he was this real big. He didn't say anything. He just looked, and I just kept on walking and I got to a place, the terrain was like a desert. No, it was like the plains out in Kansas, real flat and dry, and I walked thru these plains and it was about half the distance. And I got to a fork in the road, to this crossroad, it was all, as far as I could see, it was just flat plains, and in this crossroad, there was one house on one side, it was a white frame house, and there was another house on another side. There I saw my girl, and my girl was staying with her girlfriend that stayed in one house and her mother lived across the road, not my girl's mother, but my girl's girlfriend's mother lived in the other house across the road, and this girl and her mother haven't seen each other in two years, even though they lived right across the road from each other, because they weren't on speaking terms. So I got mad at my girl for staying at a place like that, and we were standing outside discussing it. I told her why she shouldn't stay there. But nevertheless, I told her I would pick her up the next day. So I began walking back, and it took me a shorter time to walk back than it did to get there, and everything was in unison like the place I saw when I was walking there, the same place I saw when I was walking back, and I walked thru the plain and I saw this motel with the boats with the big giant, and he was sort of standing right in the middle of the road this time, but he didn't say anything, so I just walked around. And I remember I had tennis shoes on and a pair of dungarees and a t-shirt. It was a dirt road, and then I walked back to the place where I saw there was a motel on the right hand side going back. Then I got to a bridge. It was like a bridge crossing a river and it looked like when you get off the 79th St. Causeway bridge and you come into Miami. It greatly resembled that part, and that was the end of the dream. Colors in the dream, there was blue and a lot of green, there was some grey and there was white. A little while ago my girlfriend was talking about staying with another girl, and I saw a movie called America, America, and it sort of resembled this movie in a way. This person in the movie had to walk to his destination something like I was doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2878,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:bart details,10-28-2013,"11 The dream that I had on the morning of the 4th which I just recalled now involved a friend of mine, which is a boy, and I and this girl that I've seen around, but I don't recall her name. The time was at night. We were in a small car, I think it was a convertible, and we were going hunting on a hunting range or a shooting range. I don't remember which. So we were driving down this old dirt road. There was sugar cane on both sides. The story was that we had never been in this place. That an old lady owned this shooting range. We were driving through it, and we parked the car and we heard some shooting, and people were shooting directly over our heads because we were between the firing line and the target. So we turned the car around and we went back and this old dirt, we found ourselves between a high hedge on the left and tall stacks of sugar cane on the right. On the left behind this hedge was a horserace track like Gulfstream Park. The race was in session and there was all kinds of people and noise, cars but on the right hand side of the road. It was complete wilderness, far from civilization. So we went down this road and we came upon another shooting range. We heard that the price to shoot was $10, but we thought that that was a fantastic price. My friend told me that the price to shoot was $10, but I didn't believe him, so we all got out of the car, and we started to shoot with all the rest of the people. This old woman was behind us and she was yelling at us and she said it costs $20 to shoot one round. With this woman was a nun. The nun was dressed in black and white and she didn't say anything. She was just standing with this old woman. When we found out it was $20 to shoot that was the end of the dream. The colors that I remember are black, white, green and brown. This dream doesn't seem to be too realistic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2879,,,,,Male,ID: miami_home:bart details,10-28-2013,"13 It was a hot afternoon on a Sunday and my friend and I (a male friend) wanted to go swimming. We couldn't find a place to swim, so we decided that we'd go to a hotel where I used to work in the summertime, go to the pool. So someone told us to ask for the pool manager because he was a new manager, and I didn't know him. We went to this hotel and we walked around the side of it through the pool. To get to the pool, we entered a sort of lobby and then we went on to a patio. The pool man was at the far end of the pool and he was vacuuming it, the bottom of it. The pool was extremely dirty. There was algae on the bottom. It was about half full. We went up and asked him about the pool and he immediately started talking about politics, about the presidential nominations and senators and just general political talk. But apparently he told us to go to another hotel, the DeLido Hotel, which was, we could see it from where we stood. It was down the beach. So we talked a little more about politics and then we got ready to leave to go to the DeLido to swim. Around the pool were lounge chairs. They were about half filled with people, but no one was in the pool. It was a very hot day, and as we started to leave, we had to go through two doors, one had a little square window in it. It was a wooden door. The window was about four inches square, and then there was another heavy wooden door. Then we were back in the lobby. As we opened the first door, the pool man kept on talking about politics and we couldn't seem to get him to stop. So we finally had to sort of shut him out in the pool area, so we could get back in the lobby in order to leave. So as we shut the last door, there were political figures in the lobby, politicians and mayors. There were about three of them. They were going to consult with this pool man on some problem that they had. My friend and I thought generally that he was an expert in politics. As we shut the door, the politicians got mad at us because they wanted to go out to speak to him and we were shutting them out. All this time while he was talking, he had a broom. First of all he was vacuuming when we first saw him, then he had a broom in his hand when we left and was sweeping the patio. So as we left he was talking to these politicians, giving them advice, and then we walked out in the big lobby. The lobby was in the back of the hotel instead of the usual lobby which is in front. We walked out to the car, which was my car , but it was a convertible, a white convertible. That's all I can remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2990,,,Once a week,,Female,ID: harris_2013s:001724 details,10-04-2013,"Below is an excerpt from my diary. Now and again, I will jot down my dreams when I wake up. ""A dream of many scenes, as I slept very well: I was at my childhood home in Pennington and it was New Year's Eve. My parents and I were going to take the train into NYC. I spoke to Mom who was being unusually cool. Dad was on the stairs taking too long to get ready. I knew I had to study for 30 minutes first. I went to my bedroom and tried but the time was going by faster than I could handle and my room changed into a messy dorm room with a roommate and others in the hallway. [scene change] I'm in NYC. It's night and Keya was with me. We walked around what looked and felt like midtown when suddenly I realized I'd come into the city without my parents! I called home from my mobile and realized the streets were all dark and very quiet, which was strange for NY Eve. I rationalized that by the time they got into the city, Times Square was going to be a madhouse. I worried about them in that circumstance. Keya had gotten a dinner plate of pulled pork and rice. I got one too and in spite of being vegetarian ate it anyway and thought it tasted really good - especially the meat! I told Keya I'd meet her later after I met my parents. [scene change] I was giving a talk in church. It was just me and Lauren down in the basement but my voice reverberated throughout the building as if others could hear me wherever they were sitting. I realized I was unprepared so I bragged about how much I read the scriptures. Then Kim found us and people were leaving from wherever they'd been to go to their gospel doctrine meetings. Lauren was headed through a door and up some stairs, motioned for me to follow but I told her to go on without me. I seemed to feel like I needed to grab something first so off she and Kim went. I came upon another sacrament meeting and realized if I'd just turned the corner and looked around a bit, I'd have found the people. I went back to the door and staircase I saw Lauren ascend but it led to nowhere except a dusty, run down, creepy attic I went back down, Kim found me and brought me to a basketball court-like room with metal stairs. I climbed them but the second I got to the top, they snapped and collapsed hurling me downward towards a swimming pool. I didn't fall in the water. [scene change] I was on the subway heading back to midtown (as if Church were in Queens). Then my miscarriage happened. I bled and saw the blood on the toilet paper. I felt relieved to finally have the answer, to have closure. [scene change] I walked along the upper west side. It was time to call and see Dr. S. Jim called me (or I called him?) and we chatted as I continued to walk. I told him about the problems - the HGC levels, the miscarriage. I was incredulous that I was telling him all this and yet somehow in its own way it made sense. A car stopped beside me. It was an Indian girl with some guys saying she didn't know the restaurant was that I was meeting Keya at. I mentioned to her I'd call her later since I was on the phone. [scene change] I was in a break room-looking place at Dr. S's office. He was re-explaining the complications to me which I already knew considering I was bleeding. He was distracted because a Vonni Ribisi lookalike had come in and whispered something in his ear. I spoke up and told him I thought the guy looked like Vonni and Dr. S gave me a bashful look and said ""Thank you"" and with that, he left. I sat at the table with the nurse, my suspicious about Dr. S's sexuality were confirmed given he was giggling on his way out. The 2 of them were clearly looking forward to their New Year's Eve party together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Mod,,,"$100,000 to $249,999","$150,000 to $199,999",Rarely,Asian or Pacific Islander,Married,Northeast,"College graduate (e.g., B.A., A.B., B.S.)",1-2 nights,"No, not of Hispanic origin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I at first was happy that I had all these meatballs until I realized that it was going to be almost impossible to clean it all up.

I have NO idea what this dream could possibility mean. It did not upset me...I just didn't know where it could possibly come from!

Stone, Jr., is a rather slender, young man, about 6 ft. tall, and perhaps 27 years old. His features are clean cut and his complexion healthy. I seem to be a little ways back from the table, almost directly behind Prof. Stone, who now turns to his right, evidently trying to turn around far enough to offer me his hand to shake. He says, Then .... shake in a hearty tone, and I realize (unpleasant realization as I detest secret societies) that he is intending to give me the secret shake of some organization, to which, he believes mistakenly, I belong. Says he is sure I am a No (meaning Sigma No) through he goes on to say that the Xi (meaning Sigma Xi) is almost as good. I explain that I am a Xi, but not a No, whereupon he withdraws his hand with a holier-than-thou gesture. He then looks closely for the sigma Xi key on the watch chain in my trousers watch pocket. finding none he asks me to explain. I reply, I do not choose to wear one.

Stone, Jr., who previously had seemed a pleasant fellow and very friendly to me, now took up the .... , and indirectly threatened to give the story of my disloyalty and heresy to a newspaper, which would hound me and ruin my reputation. All of them except Alan band against me, and a bitter hatred for their pretensions, hypocrisy, and imagined superiority (they had on dress clothes whereas I was in ordinary business suit) rose in me. At the same time I feel, if the worst comes to the worst, and my life is threatened with ruin, I can perhaps save something by explaining to the judge that my disrespectful attitude toward Prof. Stone, and my suggestion to Stone, Jr., that he mind his own business, were the result of my sudden anger. It also occurs to me that, in the event of losing my job, I can go on to a small farm. I now leave the banquet room and walk along a carpeted corridor in search of the elevator. After walking a considerable distance, I turn to my left down a short, dimly lighted corridor. A door way to my left looks something like entrance to elevator shaft, but I am unable to find any button for summoning the elevator. There is a radio going inside this room and I wonder a little that the management would permit such a disturbance. Soon I begin to retrace my steps, and notice another man, who evidently had made same mistake as I did, turning around also. The elevator shaft, identified by some grating of wood, is now plainly seen -- I must have walked past it before. Before I can reach elevator, the door closes and it starts to .... however before I hear someone ask for floor 6, which now seems to be the next floor down. I am fairly certain that the Stone party were on the elevator. It seems likely that I could catch elevator on next floor down, by running down the stairway but that doesn't appeal to me, even though I am still so angry with Stone that I am very anxious to add certain names to the list I had previously applied to him, but which in the stress of the argument slipped my mind. This works on me to the point of inducing me to run down stairs and perhaps catch elevator at bottom. The stairs are broad, carpeted, and not long -- only about 18 to 20 steps per flight. There is a landing or balcony about 8 or 10 steps down from each floor, and on each balcony are several black waiters just finishing the laying of several tables for breakfast for the occupants of hotel. None is eating yet, however, and I am glad they do not see me -- as I now am in shirt sleeves. The colored waiters pay no attention to me whatever as I dash down the steps, whirl at bottom by grasping banister post, and tear on down. At one place a colored waiter, going considerably faster then I am going, passes me. Finally reach the bottom, and burst in on a scene of luxury and magnificence -- flowers, expensive drapes, and marvelous decorations of all kinds -- and the dining tables crowded with women in evening dresses. Just as I enter one of the women grabs another by the hair and shakes vigorously -- a regular cat fight.

The barn had been left unlocked and I rather expected the traps had been stolen. There was a large pig in the pen (evidently a sow), and from now on the rat traps fade far into the background. A trap door in the floor of the pig pen seemed to lead to a lower compartment where the rat traps were, and also where the sow's baby pigs were kept. Someone (probably Stone), asked if the pig (or any other animal below man) could comprehend spoken words, particularly They are outside, but it was the consensus of opinion that the pig would only understand by hearing the squeals of its young. The old sow was grunting. I held a long, slender iron rod, slightly hooked at one end, whose purpose was to pry up the trap door without entering the pen. It seemed to me I should be able to detect the presence of any rats in the traps by the odor of their dead bodies. The floor in the pig pen was filthy -- covered with manure and dirty, wet straw; in this muck were 2 kinds of insects, a roach, and other kind which I at first thought might be a giant louse (pig louse). This latter insect was yellowish-brown in color, about 15 mm long, and moved about with considerable speed. It had large, claw-like front legs which were directed straight forward, and reminded me of the front legs of a cicada. The front legs seemed to claw the air when the insect was in motion.

I choose the hatchet and begin chopping up a very large plank (2 or 3 inches thick and about 15 inches wide). I have little difficulty in cutting up the plank, though the pieces look rather too long for use in a stove of furnace and I think they (or some of them) will need to be subdivided further.

It is dirty white in color, with marmoustions.... of a grayish-green color (like marble cake).

Before handing it to a botanist, Farber tells someone what he (Farber) thinks the plant will prove to be; and later, the botanist announces that it is Caroliniana or variety, which is exactly what Farber had thought.

There is another tree, E, off to the right, which has a single long limb projecting over toward tree D, but I am confident the reddish bird is not on this limb. Though it seemed that my stalking was done skillfully, and I saw no birds leaving, I was unable to locate anything except a single robin. I lay down on my back and stared up at the tree until the sun made my eyes smart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also a culvert on this side and in the culvert ditch is a half grown rabbit. There are other rabbits in the filed. I pick up the young rabbit, intending to transfer it to opposite side of field where there is a deep ditch, and much rougher land -- where rabbit will be safer. Soon after I am feeding a small flock of ravens. They are glistening black and somewhat larger than a crow. Some of them are quarrelsome, pecking rather savagely at other; and one grabs another and hangs on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3189,,,,,,,,"Walking along a dirt road and meet a man traveling on a strange tandem-arranged bicycle -- 2 bicycles connected by a tall, metal arched framework. He travels a great deal with this vehicle. At bottom of a long hill I see a wide and rather deep (6 or 8 feet) ditch across the road -- this the result of road repair work. 2 horse-drawn rigs (?buggies) cross the ditch. In each case the horse jumps across the lowest part of ditch, apparently because of a fear of getting mired or otherwise stuck. This jolts up the passenger badly. Then comes a mule drawing some kind of rig. Having more intelligence than the horses, the mule realizes a jump is unnecessary and picks his way skillfully across the rough bottom, and plods up the farther bank. Next, Chester and I are at a sort of basement entrance to a cafeteria (like Justice Dept. cafeteria). The large door way is blocked by a big hand truck piled high with filled gunny sacks. There are 2 or 3 black men standing around and one of them asks me to predict or guess how long we will be delayed by this truck. I say, 5 seconds. Some workman now begin rearranging the sacks and in perhaps a minute or two the truck is pushed out of the way. I venture what was intended as a criticism, About 6 seconds, and a black man remarks, in a half derisive tone, Ain't he smart, though. I feel embarrassed and ashamed at myself for making such puerile remarks, and though Chester says nothing, I sense that he is half contemptuous. We pass on into the cafeteria. The menu, posted on wall, lists Beef, 15 cents; apricots, 15 cents (and I am surprised that the fruit costs as much as the meat); soup, 15 cents, but only 7 1/2 cents if you take it out of building in an attractive jug which is furnished by the cafeteria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She had always impressed me as a sullen or spoiled child, but she greeted me cheerfully and I lifted her high into the air. We became very friendly. All of us walked along a hallway until coming to several low book cases (or perhaps only wooden boxes) full of books, and here I stopped to examine the books. Next, I saw Aunt Addie, very clearly, standing near by. She said, in a voice like nobody's but her's, Faye wanted me to have ____ and mentioned the name of a book. Aunt Addie, however, did not care to take the book as she had looked in her own library and found she already had a copy. Faye herself decided to take a book entitled something like Raggles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The engine is a Mallet with 6 drivers (in 2 sets of 3 each) on each side. The engine is shiny and clean, and looks brand new. Farber goes on to say that he is now getting about 2 cents per mile from his car [Note: doesn't make sense, but seemed to be what he said] I then do a little mental arithmetic; evidently to compare my own experience with his; this involves multiplying 4 x 2 1/2, giving one 10. I then seem to have good reason to answer Farber, No, not so good. Following this episode, Hoffman and I start out walking from my hometown R.R. station towards K's hill. We seem to be discussing question of car-operation cost, especially of Farber's and my car. I state that any economy test should, to mean anything, be conducted under conditions the same for both cars -- that is, gasoline, oil, etc., should be purchased at same station and, furthermore, the 2 cars should be fastened together with ropes so that they would be sure to travel the same road, at the same speed, etc. Also, the cars should be run a considerable distance -- not just a few miles. Hoffman smiles and agrees with me. By this time we have reached a rather narrow, sandy road leading off to the west. Near us, the road runs between banks 3 or 4 feet high. A mountain lion, closely pursued by a dog, runs along the road towards us. When it reaches the banks, its leaps up on the one to our right, but appears nearly exhausted and the dog grabs one of its hind legs. The lion lies on ground until the near approach of a man, who runs up with a long pole in his hands. He strikes lion several times with the pole, and then handling it as though it were a spear (one end being tapered, but not sharpened) he jabs it rapidly at the lion without actually touching the animal. The lion makes 3 or 4 fierce lunges at the man but is prevented from reaching him by the dog who holds on for dear life. The snarling lion, with widely opened mouth, is a fearsome object, but the man moves backward barely enough to avoid the claws or teeth of the lion. Evidently the man could kill the lion instantly but is giving it a fighting chance. After the fourth lunge (by which it seems to almost tear loose from the dog) the lion drops dead. I commend the man for his sportsmanship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was really confused that all these alligators started coming up the driveway. I was getting really scared when my good friend Melissa showed up out of nowhere. We started hiking up the driveway which became private property. This really old woman came skateboarding down the hill and Melissa freaked out and said we had to go a different way. We went to the right and kept going up the hill/driveway when we saw a no trespassing sign and got really scared. Then these young boys appeared and he started telling us passwords for getting up the hill. We could never see him, though, and really didn't know if we should trust him. Then he said that alligators were coming up the hill and that we better listen to him. I started telling Melissa allowed but fight my dad and I got in at lunch and that was the reason why I couldn't call her on Valentine's Day.

I wouldn't talk to him for the rest of the time and then fell asleep. I ended up getting really burned and when I woke up he was just staring at me and laughing. I asked him how he could just watch me get burned and he said that he thought it was a hilarious joke and that I was just messing around. Really irritated, I screamed, why would I burn myself for a joke? So he said, well come to think of it I guess that is pretty silly.

My parents took me to some sort of show at the ocean with performers and stuff (Abel was one of them) – poetry reading to and a guy with really dirty stained socks. Then my parents left after the long winding drive there and I was there, but I was not alone. I did some investigative reporting and ran into some of my friends, from journalism class in high school. Then we went shopping (my parents and the nameless companion) I wanted to buy flowers but they would accept checks so I had to pay Visa. We left the store but I realized that I needed something so I went back alone and picked up this package and carried the package all the way back (they wouldn't give it to me at first, I had to fight for it). But then I was back at home and my parents were incredibly depressed and totally psycho because my brother had died (I bet it was post – traumatic stress disorder) I was really afraid (not for my safety, but still scared out of my mind) when all of a sudden, my brother was alive. When our parents were busy we escaped our house and ran as fast as we could with no destination in mind. I needed to change my shirt, but I did that while we were running.

Then just outside the room were a whole bunch of pictures and a lady pointed out to me that the first four African-American girls to graduate from this school.

My friend Meredith's dad and her sister were in it. Her sister was watching an R-rated movie and Mr. Groff was mad but then uncle Jesse from the show full House (John Stamos) convinced him that it was alright except for the fact that he didn't know there were two books, so he only knew half the rules. Then I went to a really ugly vacation home (barn would be more appropriate) with my mom and stepdad it reminded me of Wisconsin except there was a beach – I think. I could see sand dunes in the distance. I was upset because it was warm and sunny and I forgot my bathing suit.

I couldn't tell if it was real or not, or if it was even on my door. Other than that awakening, I slept pretty well. The next dream incorporated Brandon Walsh from gozio, weird I know.

However when I was falling I remained calm. I remember going over one cliff and I wasn't sure if I was going to splatter when I hit but I remembered this survival story when a man let himself go limp and survived a fall from a plane when his parachute wouldn't open. I simply tried not to panic and aim for snowy parts. To go over the cliffs I would lie on my back and then use my heavy pack to pull me over the edge. One jump I aim for some trees and they caught me rather well. I met up with my friend on top of one tree and he kissed me and we kissed a little while but then it was time to get back to business and get down.

After we had warmed up the officials blew the whistle so we would go out and we were the receiving team. But I got a little stressed because I did not know that I was starting and I didn't have my socks or my shoes on yet so I hurried out to the field and then there were two of my friends in the back and they told me where to go. I now recognized the team as the Sea Hawks. The ball is kicked and one of the girls on my team (now everyone from my floor was participating) the ball bounced and we did not know if we could run with it but I told her to pick it up and run and I tried to block a guy who looked like a hockey player but for some reason he got around me and made a tackle. The official however gave the ball to the other team because the camera did not pick up the play and he did not see what happened. I still have one shoe in my hand and I had tried to block by using the shoot because I did not have any of the shoulder pads so the opposing team looked pretty big. We changed directions on the field and it changed into a giant growing moss, comparable to a water bed and we did backward summersaults as the waves carried us down the field. When the other team have the ball I tried to go after the guy with the ball but he laid down and I did not know if he was trying to trick me or if I should take the ball from him. He then got really small, about the size of an ant. His teammate said he had had an attack of some kind but I guess he was alright.Then my dream switched over to where my floor was watching an Asian play like thing. We were all standing in a line and people were running around us. Then we watched one of our friends graduate from high school, from Hawaii. I tried to find him but my eyes were not clear. Someone waved to me and I thought that it might be him so I waved back. He was very happy and was smiling. They walked by us and I tried to spot him but I still could not. Then as we were leaving I found him but I don't remember if I said anything. My dream switched over to a place kind of out in farmland. Someone sprayed water on me from a window and then no one was around but I knew someone who was “bad” was around so I tried to hide but I spotted my dad’s small pickup which was stick shift and I can drive stick but was a little nervous to try it but I jumped in and started to go and found out that it was automatic and then two people who I knew drove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He stands there, on the snow with his hands in his pockets and his beanie, he covers his forehead and part of his eyes. I feel excited to see him. I begin to snowboard and it seems as though I'm a pro, (even though, in reality I have never snowboard). For some reason there are bed there and pillows. He takes me to a specific bed, fixing the pillow and nothing happened after that. Scenes switch and I'm with my friends. It's a three day weekend and I refuse to go home because my parents have no clue my nose is pierced. I go through the Yellow Pages looking for nose. A group of people try to kill a bunch of other people. A guy I never expected pulls a knife out on me, but does not kill me. I don't remember how, but I think I save the day. The last thing I remember is the fact that a guy is walking his camel and I'm behind them. It doesn't look too much like a camel, but it is. It was spitting in circles, side to side and all over me. Until finally the owner told me to go in front of them so I don't get spit all over myself. I remember driving, but don't know where.

They all laughed and several other started to do it too. I was nervous because I thought we were going to get in trouble, so we all went to play miniature golf.

A daughter of one of the ladies at my real work was sleeping and I tried to sneak by without waking her up but I think I woke her up slightly but she went back to sleep. I was with a little kid at the beach and the child was telling me how they had been afraid once because the wave came in and they got stuck in it for a little bit. I guess I wanted to make sure that they were not afraid anymore so I carried the child out a wave and a wave came in and I let the water go around us. At first it was scarier than I had thought because it came in so fast but then I relaxed because it was a very mellow wave. However a sharp hubcap came spinning by and it could have hit us. I followed it so it wouldn't cut anyone on the beach. It disappeared under the water. But I felt for it right under the sand. When I picked it up I looked for a place to put it and spotted a garbage and I propped it up in some weeds by the side of the dumpster. I thought that the person in the park area was going to say something to me because I had the hubcap but they didn't. It was kinda scary at first because the hubcap acted like a blade and I thought it might cut child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do not know what kind of fields but some of them had tiny white flowers. I was to run to the other side of campus to meet someone. It was getting kind of late and I was a little nervous to go alone. Well at first it was no big deal but then my destination kept getting farther and farther out of view. The fields were on rolling hills so I would run as fast as I could to the top of one and when I would get near the top I was able to jump and fly for a little ways because of my momentum. There are people driving on side roads but I do not want them to see me. I continue to look for my destination from the tops of hills, I then spot my parents and the people I was looking appear before me and a house then appears. We go downstairs and they are still in the processes of painting. It is very unusual with fluorescent plastic bags hanging from the ceiling. I then meet up with some of my friends. One guy asks me to dance while another guy leaves and asks his friend to dance with his date but the friend decide to dance with me. I'm not quite sure but the guy who owns the house was mad at something and I had a bad feeling about him from the start. He asked if he could pour some little pieces of pink wax on us and I said no but then spotted some ceramic stuff so I said okay and directed all the stuff onto his ceramics and breakables, it did not break anything just cover them. Everyone was trying to escape and my mom, dad, sister and two cousins ran out through a slit in the fence. There was a string that we were to follow to find our way home. My parents were being slow and my mom was reeling in the string as we went. I told them that we do not need to do that but just hurry. The string was hooked too many bullets that were full of pain needles and pinecones. Kind of like booby traps for us. We just kicked them as we passed. We were running through a dry forest. When we got to the top I looked back and my mom screamed bear and I said don't say that that's not a bear because I thought she misinterpreted the black stump behind my dad. Then I spotted some cubs and got a little scared. I tried to climb a tree but then I remembered that bears climb trees so when the bear was coming after me I jumped down and so did the bear. I had its jaws between my hands to keep it from biting me. A door opened in front of us and I think someone called the bear and we went through but I can't remember the rest. My other dream I was at my sister's house. She had just put her house down and the lawn was already grown with some cherry trees in the back. I was touring the yard and my niece would climb and swing from the swings that were usually high. The ladder was propped up against them and I thought that they were not very safe for her but she seemed very successful and experienced on accomplishing swinging. I had a dream earlier on. I think I woke up to my alarm at 7:20 AM which woke me up from my dream. I thought that I would be able to remember it but I do not. These last two dreams I believe I dreamt after 7:20 AM yesterday I found out that my sister's house will be done in a couple weeks and I am still excited about the dance that I am invited to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything went okay, but when we got to her house they all went upstairs and left me downstairs talking to her aunt and uncle. When I looked at my watch it was 7 PM and they were still upstairs. Finally my roommate came downstairs and I got upset and told her what time it was so since it was a 6 Hour drive back we decided to catch a plane since it was only an hour flight. When we got to the airport we got a flight, but then it switched to where I was back at my high school with all the students from my class and in order to get back on we had to jump off of a bridge (like the second floor of the building) into this cart that look like a train. There were a lot of people pushing trying to make the flight but my friend Denny from high school was already in the cart and told me he would catch me so I jumped.

When I started to clean my uncle came in and started helping me. (I don't know which uncle it was because he didn't have a face, or I never looked at his face but it was understood that he was my uncle) right when we got the table clean the phone rang and it was for him so he was talking on the phone when all a sudden a kitten jumped on the table and knocked over a pile of papers we had and made the table a mess again. My uncle started yelling at the kitten and I got mad at him and picked up the kitten and went into my room. When I got in my room my dad came and asked me why I was upset, I told him, and he left and went into the living room to talk to my uncle. I then began talking to the kitten asking why it jumped on the table like that and the kitten could talk. Explained to me that she did it because she had a lot of fleas and that she wanted me to scratch her back. I got out my cat brush and my flea comb, and began grooming her while we talked. We had a long conversation where she was explaining to me all the weird things that cats do and why they do them. My dad came back into my room and was standing in the doorway, but before he said anything my alarm went off and I woke up. (I couldn't control anything in the dream it was just like I was watching a movie.) [I'm not weird or gross but I have four cats at home and we always get stray kittens. All of my cats that we have now are kittens that we found or were given. Every time we get a new kitten they usually have a lot of fleas and are really dirty. I used to want to be a veterinarian and so I went out and bought all kinds of flea combs and brushes so that I could clean all of our new cats up. I flea comb them again before I give them a bath and kill as many fleas as I can then I give them a bath, then I flea comb and again to make sure all the fleas are gone. Also I am really interested in why cats behave the way they do so having a conversation with the kitten was not that weird to me because it was something that I always wished I could do.]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Snow felt warm, fire didn't burn, and tide pool appeared on a regular street in the tide came in instantaneously. There was no real storyline but I was merely watching events happening to people. In one event a guy around 20 runs into a burning house after dog. His mother screams outside as the house goes up in flames. I see him inside on fire and he exits through a side window and down a ladder and unharmed. Then there are people on the mountain behind the house (burning house) playing in the snow. The mountain is actually very steep and they are trying not to fall off while laughing, talking, and playing in this snow that is warm and grainy to the touch. Having never been in snow in my life I thought that this wasn’t bad. The sun was bright and the sky clear when I left the mountain for a neighborhood street. However, they home turned into rocks and tide pools while the asphalt turned into sand. Water started coming in in forming pools of water. Little boys came out to play in them. Splashing around while laughing and playing. One of them saw me and thought I was his schoolteacher. Asking me a question which I couldn't understand he ran into the water to join the others. All around were trees like a jungle yet behind me there was still a house. I entered it and went to the third floor. Looking out of a window I could see all the events of my dream like a stage set. With the mountain and the burning house and other things I can't recall now. Looking back towards the tide pool I notice that the water level had just risen three feet before my eyes. The boys were no where to be seen. Socks and shoes floated on the surface of the water. A eerie foreboding came over me. The brightness of the day dimmed and I was back on the mountain clawing at the warm snow trying to cause an avalanche.

The first I recall so vividly a stream set back in the mountains but not too far from the city. I was with some friends and we were floating in this shallow stream lying on our backs looking up at the afternoon sky laying, talking, and splashing around. I could feel the coolness of the water and the warmth of the rays of sun on my face. The water also had a delightfully fresh smell to it. The next moment I looked up I saw a white pipeline running through the forest right over us. It was small about 6 inches in diameter. But the weird thing about it was that it just appeared out of nowhere. I looked at it again and realized that water was dripping out of it onto us. Then a second pipe appeared, both resembling irrigation systems. No one else seemed to notice but me. Then the water which was initially shallow began to rise sharply the current increased and the sun went behind a cloud. Suddenly I was holding onto little babies or puppies that had been playing in the water. I was so afraid they're going to drown and get sucked away by the current that was now rapids pulling us downstream. I was scared because my friends were gone and I knew at any moment I'd let go of the kids I was holding and we’d all drown. Suddenly I was out of the creek and back at my old job from high school. I was so happy to be there which was odd since I complained and hated it when I used to work there. My old boss and some of my coworkers were there and I felt safe and happy. Life was simple again. I told them so, that I was so happy to be back. The layout of the store was very different from when I worked there. The store was Esprit and all the sections were mixed up. Thinking about it I realized the store resembled the last time I was in their a few months back not when I worked there two years ago. Also the people working there had also blessed Edmund on, even my boss, but strangely enough they were there and so was I. I sun was shining again through the glass front of the store. This lady appeared and she was looking through the glass directly at me. She was about mid 40s, Hispanic, overweight, with hair that looks dyed. She came in and walked up to me with tears in her eyes. Grabbing my arm she held it to her face say over and over, I'm sorry I misjudged you, I'm sorry I misjudged you, you come back. I could feel her wet tears on my arm and I feel sad and perplexed at the same time because I didn't know what she meant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dreamt I was walking through this beautiful place on like a beach with a stream, not an ocean, and the water was a beautiful green. I was with a beautiful brown girl who had the best tan I’d I seen in my life. It was very hot and I was on vacation. I asked her where we were and she said, Italia. We talk to people she knew, all had thick Italian accents. I turned out that my dad was adopted and I met his parents for the first time, during the trip. We (the girl and I) went to a theater where they played 24 hours of movies for one quarter so we watched like three, all the while talking with other people. Then I was still in Italy but I was leading the two X-Files agents on some mission. I knew what would happen because I had seen that episode. We had to walk up this staircase all the while demons and skeletons were moving and trying to scare us. The stairs would open and things would pop out. It was hot and fiery like hell with a pit of lava in the middle of the spiraling staircase. I was almost to the top when one agent turned around, I protested saying we all had to leave if one did, we all turned around and the creatures were telling us we couldn't leave. I was almost at the doorway to exit it and I jumped off the last three steps. This was not allowed and I was going to have to go in the lava when I said that those rules don't apply to Americans.

The furniture was the way it was back then even though it's since been changed and the house remodeled. I felt sad while watching those scenes replay to the point of tears. Trying to analyze the feeling while dreaming led me. Even more bizarre events. In the next dream I felt like I was on the edge of a cliff ready to fall off and I felt so terrified that I couldn't even scream. I felt like I was slipping slowly into an abyss and everything I did while trying to prevent myself from falling were in vain. The edge came closer and it was rough and hard to the touch. Gravel was breaking off the cliffs edge shortening it. I felt cold then hot and I was surrounded by blackness this but the cliff was clear, rocky brownish and fully illuminate by some source of light. I was all surreal and suddenly I woke up for a second to realize I was at the very edge of my lofted bed. I quickly moved and fell back to sleep into another dream, this time it is two images, one purple, the other yellow were floating past me. They were roundish this and suspended below a foggy haze. I wanted them to go away but they wouldn’t everywhere I went they seemed to follow floating on this cloud of nothingness. Then a gate appeared tall, wide, iron spiked points. Some of it was rusty with age giving it a brownish red tone. This too was illuminate by some unknown light source while the surrounding area was in blackness. I grab the gate and it was cold and rough to the touch. Somehow I was able to taste it as I touched it and it was a horrible acidic flavor that left me gagging. I grabbed lock and yanked and pulled on it but it wouldn’t budge. Looking through the keyhole I saw or felt peace, like I found a happy place weren’t crazy. But I could only see it because I couldn't get the lock open. I thought of climbing the gate but as I looked up the top descended above the clouds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3261,,,,,Female,ID: sersa:m308 details,02-18-2013,"Last night I dreamt about going on a camping trip with a lot of people (about five people including my friends and boyfriend). But already and the cabins were a bunch of people I didn't really know. There was about eight – ten people per cabinet and I remember bringing my cordless telephone, a coffee maker (I don't drink a lot of coffee and in real life) and a television set. The coffee maker was accidentally left on and the coffee pot melted and warped. The telephone was used to call my boyfriend’s cell phone. It was on the other side of the camp site. Also I remember a bright green bag-like a carry–on. I don't know who’s it was. The campsite was very similar to a place I used to go when I was younger. So it was very familiar. At one point it was pouring rain outside the window of the cabin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3262,,,,,Female,ID: sersa:m221 details,02-18-2013,"This dream was simply bizarre. It started with me being at home but things were far from normal. My parents were is some musical event and needed a microphone so they sent me across the street to this crazy, carnival like shopping mall. All of this was happening at night with a full moon, clear starlight sky, yet apparent rain puddles everywhere. The shopping center was very bright, full of lights, color, toys, hardware, food, and lots of noise. It was surprisingly busy for this time of night and it was difficult trying to find what I was looking for. I needed a electronic shop yet every time I'd see one it would disappear or hide behind another shop. I could remember the detail on the microphone I was trying to find right down to the make, model, and serial number. Some may recall was pretty good. Suddenly my little brother shows up and tells me I'm looking in the wrong place and that he'll take care of it. I find myself home again only this time in my own room devoid of richer except for curtains and mini blinds on the window. There was a swing of some sort in my room so I go on it and began swinging, twirling, and floating around in circles. I hear people talking to me almost in rebuke but I didn't care, it was like being a kid again. On the old swing when at the park where I'd grown up. Just feel and careless, however, I noticed outside that strange little people were coming down the block towards my house (my house is at the corner where two neighborhood streets intersect) I thought they were kids but they were definitely not because they were riding strange electric bikes and had on this armor over their top torso which was purple and dark blue. They had some sort of gun I've never seen before and they go in a fight with what looked like police or somebody chasing them. Suddenly I was outside with them and feeling fear and apprehension. The rest is rather bizarre and harder to follow but goes like this. I’m seen, of course, and they push me along with them to the end of the block. They don't speak at all but they look human except their faces are rather purpleish blue. I get the end of the street where there are tons of them with bikes, vans, cars…, And lots of regular people all in a group watching them. Maybe they were there against their will or maybe just curiosity. I ran into my best friend Christine who seemed very worried telling me we got to get out of here, JR and Charles (two of her guy friends) are trying to get a car. (I found this line funny since she tells me this every weekend when we want to get off campus and go somewhere close) JR pulls up in a car and she gets in but I wait because I see them (the strange people) looking at this pregnant woman and the guy standing by her in a funny way. Instantaneously they're both gone. Now, scared I get in the car and we take off. We start going faster and faster but were being followed. It seems like we drive forever until we reach daylight. Were crossing this body of water and the water is practically coming onto the roadway. We are informed that it is the Mississippi River. How we got there from California I don't know. Thinking all is safe, we stopped to get something to eat only to find that they're right behind us. We starting running through shopping malls and finally across an intersection towards a building where we steal a car and take off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I look at my bed and I see huge quarters littered inside my covers. They are the size of my head. I keep searching for more hoping I find more money. There is so much change both large and normal sized and in pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. I am thinking that I must be dreaming because the change is so large but at the same time I am excited that I am so rich. Suddenly I am in an outside area where I have traveled to with my mom. Though never mentioned, I know my mom is there to pick up my sister. My mom has left and the area is based in the cement but surrounded by trees and gode with random trees spread out. I see a sauna and I walk into it. Though previously clothed I now realize my breasts are exposed but I never realize if I am completely naked. I am completely comfortable and I can feel the warm water on my body, like the water of a hot bath that has cooled considerably. People are randomly walking by, as if in a park, but they do not stare, instead I see a glance but as if I am a tree or something. There are not many people, maybe three pass by the whole time, but there is a man close by that I pay nearly no attention to, simply aware of his presence. I look around the cement sauna and I notice pictures, like simple outlines, almost like ancient drawings from Aztec or Egyptian hieroglyphics, surrounding the cement canopy over the sauna. They are of erotic scenes between the sexes and it is then that I feel ashamed and embarrassed to be in the water. I think maybe it is a place of sinful pleasure. I'm still there, now not exposed and a small girl offers to cut my hair. I decline after seeing the horrible job she has done on another. I see as she cuts the hair of others in random places and it looks awful. I abruptly wake up to my alarm and see my roommate, and two friends. My roommate has also just risen and exclaims claims she has to go to Benson for the great fries, a friend confesses she has pulled an all nighter and while the other turns on a lamp to read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So they made it and it was okay. We had a good time talking and then we got ready to leave. We went to the cash register (the weird because this is an upscale restaurant that takes the check at the table). The bill was like $1000. We were floored. Henry was looking for a credit card to pay and they asked us if we'd like to charge part and finance part of the bill. We talked about the interest on the charge and decided to put the whole balance on one card. It was kind of quiet there though and it's usually noisy. The cash register was on the hostess stand. Henry and I weren't upset, we were just shocked. I feel pretty awake this morning. I have to get morning. Henry is staying home with Grant, thank goodness.

Then I was crying telling a group of people that last year I had helped to tear down a huge area of bleachers, and they weren't impressed even though it was hard work. So I wandered around and caught up with my friend, Laurie, who was carrying a drink mixed up by a witch. It was a sake bomb made with some root of tea. I left her and went back to tell more people about how I tore down the bleachers, but no one wanted to listen so I ate a piece of pizza with jalapenos in it. My second dream was more disturbing. I was just hanging out in some sort of an apartment when my sister Katie and her ex-boyfriend came to visit. They were trying to cheer me up because in real life I told Mark I like him, and he said he just wants to be friends). So they were talking with me, and my mom appeared to make me beef barley soup, like she always used to do when I was sick, but I didn't want any. Then we went outside where there was a patio with a big stone wall, and Mark was there, but I didn't want to talk to him. Adam, my ex, also showed up and things just got awkward, so I went back inside and hid under a blanket. Then I was riding my bike down a street to a mall where there was a bingo game going on.

I was having lots of fun, feeling confident and happy but then our friend Kyle (we call him Richard Alcohol) looked at me all weird, and said that I looked really weird. Or he didn't say it, but from the look on his face, I could tell he thought that. Then, everyone looked at my soaking wet face all weird as if my face transformed or shedded into something not fun to look at. I got really self – conscious all of a sudden and really really upset as my smile faded and I looked around me feeling defeated. Jump to next dream… We were (me and my best bud here, Molly, and my brother I think and someone else – I'm not sure who – maybe molly's bro Tim) at my house in MD. Only it was a brand new, huge house. And we were just kind of playing in the yard on the side of the house. When the other person – maybe Tim – came back over to the side of the huge, grand, beautiful house with gardening boxes. I guess we were going to plant a garden on the side yard of the house, bordering the long straight narrow wooden canopy – hall (exactly like the one in mission garden) with some sort of pretty plant. Molly and I and I guess our bros? got really excited to make the yard look all pretty with these plants. Then Tim was like, no look at the plants. They're not just pretty. Molly and I looked at them and it dawned on us what it was whoa! It’s not weeds, it's weed! Whoa, were planting marijuana plants? We got pretty excited because we thought it was really really funny. And nobody will ever know because it's just so pretty and on the side of the house looking like bushes. Suddenly the beautiful, big fun house was not even the main center of attention anymore. Though I still knew it was still the main main thing to me in the back of my mind. Even though we were excited, and all I caught up in the moment the house was still the most precious thing to me since it was so big, fun, and provided such awesome beautiful background.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally I went back in the room Aldo was testing everyone, and I sat down next to my girl Mariah, who plays the other fairy with me. She looked frustrated. Dude he called you twice. You weren't here. Ow jeez, he'll understand I know it. But then Aldo just looked right through me and laughed to himself. I called you three times girl, you weren't here. I had to jump to the more important people in the play. In one second I was crushed. I wanted to suddenly quit. This was not the guy I admired, this was so not like him. Then my subconscious told me that I was right – that Aldo was not like that – so I could make him like how he's supposed to be. So I did. I changed that he was normal, and told me to just do my scene and a few. I went into another room and started practicing. Suddenly it was time for us to go perform – in the garage's of Swig connected to my hall. We went in running amok. Suddenly I saw a cherry fall from out of the thing that squeezed it out. Rumor had it that this would be in Texas on spring break. I know you are not supposed to feel like you're making a sacrifice to be in the play it's a privilege and I knew it, but… must it interfere with spring break? What? Texas? Spring break? I'm supposed to be going to San Diego. Uh uh that's not fair. I was majorly upset and I was in the dressing room kind of pissed off when I saw Christina Aguilera in there – I guess getting ready for something. She saw I was on the upset and I walked away from her – I've always been under the impression that she was fake and cocky just dumb like that. I didn't want to talk to this girl. Then she talked, and it turned out she was a down-to-earth nice person. What's wrong? I told her the deal. She said hey, it'll probably be fine, I'm thinking, maybe just as fun as San Diego. Then I thought about it and I realized she was right. I wasn't really tight with everybody we were going to San Diego with an Texas I didn't know everybody in the play and plus it's Texas, maybe not beautiful sunny San Diego but where my good good friend Jess is from.

I just sat there feeling the sun warm my face. I felt totally at peace. I then open my eyes and I was no longer on my horse nor was I in the countryside. I was in a large city with the hustle and the bustle of the city around me. The people were all moving around me like I was not there, but there was no noise I could still feel the warmth of the sun. Then a cloud came over the sun and just as it did the honking, the voices, the footsteps came alive. Just the sounds of the city. They all started up, people were no longer moving around me.

Much unlike any of my other dreams, I was more of a detached observer. In my dream last night I had a dream about my first love, my high school sweet heart. My dream was a reenactment of the night we both lost our virginity to each other. I honestly don't have any idea where the dream came from, but it was a perfect picture of that night. Everything was perfectly clear. It was Valentine's Day and we had been together two years. He had me a romantic dinner (fondue) that he took to a spot in the mountains on a cliff overlooking the lake. His best friend kidnapped me and blindfolded me and took me to have dinner there were candles and music. He brought his laptop to play music. It was so cute. The beginning was a little cold but so perfect. We ate dinner and then he gave me a beautiful diamond ring (a promise ring). I still wear today. After dinner we went back to his house. In his room there were tons of candles lit, music playing, rose petal all over the bed and floor and a dozen red roses beautifully set on the pillow. He had put black satin sheets on the bed for the occasion. The song playing was It's Your Love by Tim McGraw. I remember being scared, nervous, but excited and ready at the same time.

I landed, and I turned around to find him, everything began to spin around me as I stood still screaming his name. He was down. I ran back up the hill and I was the first one to reach him. He was bleeding out of his mouth and I assume his ears because blood was running out of his helmet. I picked up his body shaking and screaming, just holding him and crying say I love you baby. I knew at that moment he was dead. I can't see anyone around me clearly. Memories of times we spent together flash through my head.

With a jacket that had a fur collar, eyeliner and mascara, and looked like a girl. I don't remember what he was saying, but I remember commenting that he looked like a hooker. The ride was one of those 3-D action – modeling ones. It was a red train, and the cars were very rounded in their shape. I think the number of cars lessened as the dream went on. We wound around. There was one time I missed getting on, and I jumped in as it was moving but it was moving really fast and I was dangling on the side for a while. I finally got in. Then, we entered a space – age car with neon lights and all the parents and older people left, and it was just students. The cups that were in front of us. It seemed normal that they were there but I think they just appeared out of the blue, were half – filled with juice, but then it slipped (there was a division of vertically through the center of the cups) and the other half and held beer. Everyone gulped down both, and people were stumbling about, one of my friends was there and I was helping her walk around. Somehow, we were back on the train – it had open seats – no roof – and the interesting thing was that the conductor always asked us which way we wanted to go when the road split and I made the decisions. There was also a fight scene in a cave that was a tunnel with orange neon lights, that went all the way down. And there was a bad monster who spoke English and was trying to win me and another opponent, although we knew it was just like a videogame, so I wasn't really concerned. I had my weapon, but as soon as I threw it at him, he said, that was stupid or something, and zapped me with a laser beam.

Me and my friends got out of the house really fast. Then we were back in my neighborhood so we started walking to my house. The neighborhood changed and we were in snow surrounded by huge houses. We were running in circles trying to figure out where we were. I kept getting glimpses of the evil spirit. Finally some guys from my floor drove us and took us away but before this me my friend were sliding down roofs of houses and such things. At one point in my dream my mom was pissed at my dad and he came to the party late",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The floors went from floor one on top to two then three then basement. Floor one was above ground level, but the rest went down into the ground. I was signing up to live here next year and I put that I wanted to live on the third floor even though I had never been down there. I decided to go down. There weren't many rooms down there and the hallway was really dark. There was a hole in the wall that said math study above it. I walked down the hall and asked this boy who was actually a girl if I could see her room. She showed me and inside were two queen size beds. The room was huge. Afterwards, we had a house meeting which was sort of like a class. Everyone kept getting up and grabbing stuff from their room. The teacher told them to stop. He said we could take a break. Everyone left except a few of us and never came back. The teacher told us that they would be punished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Again, I had another weird dream that started out bad that as the dream went on, it became funny instead of scary. Last night, I had this dream that there was an earthquake at this place that I was taking a vacation in. I think it was Disneyland, I'm not so sure. Then they had to evacuate us and we had to get on one of those little racing cars at carnivals and stuff. But when we got on the freeway there was traffic and so we had to wait but somehow the cars disappeared and now we were just standing in line waiting. There were police cars too, but that they couldn't do anything. We were more annoyed than scared and everyone was complaining about the long lines and everyone was trying to cut in front of each other. Finally we got to where we were supposed to, I guess it was supposed to be a safe place for us to hide from the disaster. But this time everyone was trying to find a bathroom and again fought to get access first. It was now more like a gathering at the park or something. Then the alarm went off so I had to get up. I was a little confused at first but I was reasonably calm and didn't think anything bad would happen. I wasn't that scared either and by the end of the dream I think I forgot the reason for my evacuation. I woke up smiling thinking about the dream because it was just so silly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I woke up several times and would roll over and fall right back to sleep. But a few time I had to actually get out of bed and walk around because I was so uncomfortable. It was pretty miserable. I remember being hot and my body ached. It sucked! As far as my dream goes, I don't remember how I got to where I was or why everything was happening. All I remember is being in a parking lot with my family. The location was fairly familiar to me. It seemed like a business district to me, one that I live near at home. My mom and younger sister were in the car, but I was standing in the middle of the parking lot near a median with buildings towering behind me. My dad was standing nearby. There was someone else too that I could depict a face, but I couldn't recognize the man. He was driving some fancy sports car. The car was yellow with white racing stripes. He was chasing me around the parking lot like he was trying to kill me. My dad was trying to stop him. I tried throwing rocks at his car but he would turn around and throwing things at my back. I do remember it hurting. Then all of the sudden the man got out of his car and I was trying to beat him up. There was now a parking structure. He started to beat me to the ground when my dad intervened and I woke up for some reason it wasn't particularly scary. My nightmares tend to pertain to specific events in my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dreamt that the lacrosse team had decided to buy a house and I decided to move out of my dorm room into the lacrosse house. The house was huge, it had about 18 rooms because we each had our own room. It house had three stories, with rooms on the top floor, second floor and four rooms on the bottom floor with a huge kitchen, living room, dining room etc. The whole house was furnished I remember going into the house. The first place I went was the kitchen. The shelves were stocked with Hershey’s syrup and caramel. The I went around with one of the captains and looked at all the rooms. Each one was set up already and each floor had a TV area. I was the last one to move in. The weird thing was that one of the girls living in the house was a friend of mine from high school who I haven't talked to since graduation. Then I remember beginning to move in my stuff. I got one of my guy friends to help me move my stuff. I got my bed in the room at the house the I called my parents to ask them if it would be okay if they paid rent. They asked about refunds from the dorms which I didn't know about. I remember telling them I needed to know that day, but I don't remember if they ever say yes. I stood and talked to them in the rain on the phone. I think I woke up at this point.

I found myself sitting in my performance and culture to class here at Santa Clara University. Everything seemed fairly normal. I was sitting in my usual spot, surrounded by the usual classmates doing what I always do: taking notes. I don't really remember details like clothing or color: I guess it wasn't really important to me. All of the sudden I became part of the lecture, in that I found myself in the time that we were discussing except that I was with my friends doing our usual activities. Things from this point on seem to jump around, and it's a little shady because I only remember part. The next thing I remember is planning a big group date with three of my girlfriends. We had decided to go shopping for new outfits and bathing suits because we had planned to go hot tubbing after the dinner we planned. We went shopping, but all I remember buying is our bath suits. We all bought the same one only in different colors – – baby blue, maroon–purple, melon, and I can’t picture the last one. Then my dream skips to the actual date. All I actually see is the eight of us in the hot tub. The hot tub seems to be in the mountains, surrounded by thick forest. No one else is around. It kind of seems as though it is hanging in the trees. We are all talking, flirting having a great time. The last thing I remember from my dream is changing putting my suit in a shoebox and leaving in a car I cannot recognize that date I also can't see his face. This is the point at which I woke up. I slept extremely well last night. I fell asleep fast and slept all through the night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So then she moved, Bill Clinton also signed some kind of long skinny paper with Hillary's name and Becky – (not Chelsea) He signed Becky twice. I told him he already signed it once. Then later I got to see more of Bill Clinton paintings. They were landscapes. But the water in the seascape actually moved. Then George W.

On a rack of a bunch of picture frames there was a white vinyl jacket that was small and had a picture of Joan Rivers with black hair, a black leather jacket and red lipstick, like a biker.

I pouted a little and he put his arms around my waist from behind me and started kissing me on my cheek.

At that point I had been dreaming I was in a desert. It was hot and sunny and there was a little stream running through. So anyways I was with my family and two other people – my pastor for my church and my sister's fiancée. We were stopped and resting because we had been walking a long time. I was filling up with yellow cup with water from the stream and a water snake jumped out and attached itself to my shin and was biting me so hard. I was freaking out. It didn't really hurt, but I was so scared and I was freaking out because it was a big snake. Nobody was helping me either because they were all freaked out as well. Finally Brad, (see my sister's fiancé) took this big long stick that he had with him for some unknown reason, and he hit the snakes tail so it would let go of me and nobody understood why I was mad that they would not help me out. The other one I remembered was a little more realistic. I know exactly why I dreamed it, too, because I have been nervous about this lately. A couple days ago I was a little drunk and I said some rude stuff to my friend Jill about a mutual friend of ours named Megan. Since then, I've been a little nervous that Megan might find out and I dreamt that she did! Jill hadn't been the one who told her, but instead Jill had told another girl and she had been told Megan. Also, in my dream I had said worse things about her than I had in real life. Anyways, in this dream everything that I fear will happen did. She got totally pissed at me and then we were out to dinner at Taco Bell (over by Safeway) and it all came out and there were so many people there and she was screaming at me and I was so embarrassed but I knew I deserved it for talking about her. So she slapped me in front of all the people and everyone was staring and so shocked! It wasn't really a nightmare but it felt like I was living out something I have been thinking and worrying about a whole lot lately.

All I kept seeing were these pictures of accidents and destruction (car wrecks, earthquakes, ect.) I figured these were pictures we were going to respond to when we had finished all of our journal entries. But then I realized, there were so many pictures and they were all negative, I knew I was dreaming. So I woke myself up.

We are singing some pioneer songs, but we keep practicing Ubi Caritas, even though we know it. I feel we are not fully prepared for the concert, but then I am not in the concert, but afterwards I see pictures of the choir members carrying my friend (also in the choir) above their heads during the first song, to add some excitement to the show. Then I see pictures of myself in the concert being lifted up and then diving from their hands to the couch. I totally laugh, wondering how they even got me to do that. I go to show my mom the pictures, but she has already seen them. In another dream, I am walking home to my house in southern California with my friend Charlotte. We are walking through/down these hills and we get alongside the coast. We are standing at the top of these sandy cliffs and Charlotte, the avid hiker, is asking me if I want to take this special hike, named after some guy, down the cliff (a long ways) so that we can walk alongside the ocean. The other option is to walk along the cliffs, and I am scared of falling off and I would rather get to the seashore so that I will feel secure. We start going down the cliff, with many other people - it's some kind of tourist attraction. We are practically going straight down these cliffs, which are not solid sand at all, so I keep sinking my hands and feet in them, which I guess is supposed to support me, but I feel certain I will fall. There are also yellow and black cords around to sort of hold on to. When we reached the bottom, our other two friends are suddenly with us. We are looking for a restroom - there are many of them, but all the toilets are in a big room of this house-like place. We go to the bathroom and then climb back up the cliffs. So then we are on a street in a town and it is snowing, although the sand is part of the snow. I put on the hood of my gray SCU sweatshirt over my head and keep my umbrella over my head. I got this umbrella when I was going down the cliffs - we were supposed to have one so that sand from the people above us would not fall on us directly. Also, when my friends and I were at the restroom/tourist house, I found a pin that said Ubi Caritas on it. And my friends asked what it means and I tell them: Where true love and charity are found, God is there. This confuses my friend Kat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then the scene changed to a bar. The girl's sister was there and it turned out that she was actually alive. I remember thinking, Just like a soap opera, there is a twist.

Inside there were some nuns but they didn't look like regular nuns. They had shaved off their eyebrows completely and penciled them in. They had really shiny faces, like wax, and they had rosy red cheeks and dark red lipstick. They were bald and they only had a patch of hair with a braid coming out of it. We left the candy store because we heard one of our friends yelling down the hill. We went down there and she warned us not to stay with those nuns because they were wealthy yet corrupt. We didn't want to believe this because we liked those nuns, so we went back up the hill and it was like the nun had heard us because she changed into the outfit of a poor nun, and then we hugged her and picked her up (because she was really small and skinny) and carried her down hill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was also feeling bad because I was kind of throwing the party without Zoe’s permission, plus her mom was coming home – (although her parents are cool about parties but the house was a mess).

When he was describing his killings he walked right up to me. Denzel was very worried and limped over to me and knelt down on the floor saying he didn't want anything to happen to me. I held him and comforted him. Then he and I left and we had just purchased a brand new dark green SUV for our country house.

Instead my cousin Beth helped me to pick out new sandals. They had really high heels, but were comfy. I tried on three pairs. I looked in the mirror. She also wanted me to buy a hat. There were also purses on sale on the wall and they had pictures of my family/relatives when they were younger. While in line to get food, it was so hot and I was wearing a thick black dress.

When I got to my car, I could only find one brace, so I ran back down, but by the time I got back the game was over, and my friend was gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also dreamt that there was this guy who had little abilities to do certain things, like he was a robot. He was trying to overcome this so he wanted to do something he wasn't told. He ran after me with a bucket of water and held it over my head, demonstrating how he could dump it on me. Another time, we were running down the freeway at the rate cars drive, it was very much like we were driving but we weren't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3434,,,,,Female,ID: sersa:1212 details,02-18-2013,"I remember being on a crowded train/subway. It was in some European country (Italy or France, based on language). I was attempted to not make it obvious I was foreign by trying to act like I understood what people were saying and not actually talking to people. I made it to the front of the car, by the exit. In the first row of seats was a young boy, sitting with his father, but I didn't notice the father for a minute. The little boy started to try to talk/flirt with me, which I thought was cute and amusing, although I could only translate a few words. At one point, a man next to me, speaking with an American accent, asked me what they were saying, and I tried to reply in a not very obvious manner that I wasn't really sure as I was still trying to mentally translate the words. The father turned to the boy (probably age 6-8) and told him, apparently in English, that he should try singing to me, which should win me over. The boy shyly replied to his father that he couldn't really remember the song, and would his father help him. They started to sing the song, in French, but the little boy got embarrassed and hopped over the back of the seat and partially hid but the father continued singing. At the end of the song, the father's voice went into an impressively clear and true tenor. When I looked surprised he explained that he played trumpet (i.e. very good air control and strength). I think they may have overheard my statement to the other American, which is why they switched to English (other people had tried to talk to me in the foreign language as I made my way through the train). I then was talked into leaving the train with them to go somewhere. I guess the dream sort of shifts at this point, because I am no longer female! I was a somewhat new son-in-law/brother-in-law at a large farm. I think they made wine and also had sheep. It was sheep shearing time and we were all helping out. The wool was apparently trimmed off with sort of laser. It made the sheep nervous and/or if the sheep moved they could be seriously injured by this laser. The scene switches to my brother-in-law discussing with some other villager/laborer why I have such trouble with helping out with the job and seemed to have so much empathy with the sheep. He tells a sad story of how I was found abandoned by wolves (visual switches to deserted island with lone pair of wolves and deserted baby, with narrative guiding the scenes). The wolves had a single pup, in the nursing stage. They brought me back to their den and I proceeded to be raised by wolves, but not for very long. The wolves decided that it would be wrong for me to be raised by them as I wouldn't learn the correct actions of my species. Because it was a small, deserted, island, they had to get me to stay out in the open so a passing plane, etc. could see me. The only way they could do that was to leave their single pup with me (and hope they could have another one or more the following season. They believed they were the only wolves on the island). They took us up to a deserted, open, high meadow and left us there. We fell asleep, cuddled together, next to a rock and were discovered and saved by a passing helicopter. Scene goes back to the barn area where the story is being told regarding why I have so much empathy for the animals. The brother-in-law then comes over to me and tells me he's thirsty. I look up at him from my work in surprise, but can tell he is up to something, so I go along with it. At this point, I seem to have a European accent, and everyone else is American, but like a scene out of Walk in the Clouds. We walk over to shelves in the very large corner of the barn and he proceeds to tell me that he's going to have some wine, and tries to offer me some. It is known that someone that has been drinking will not be trusted to help with the shearing, and he is trying to provide me as escape from the duty he knows I dislike. I agree and he proceeds to look on the shelves and choose from a couple choices of red and white wine. I choose to have red (they are all warm, red is at least supposed to be drunk warm). Soon after I select a glass and have a small sip, the father-in-law walks in, sees us drinking, and somewhat angrily tells us we can no longer help with the work. The brother-in-law somewhat triumphantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Japanese man is trying to rent me skis with very old bindings. I refuse and say I want skis with bindings from at least 1970. He finds the bindings. But the wind is coming up so hard that I can't go skiing anymore. I am on the trek. There was a murder to be committed and I thought that one of the brothers was doing it.

We're being brought to the earliest intermediate station, the moon, and there one of the women takes me and shows me around. It is a dark place. It is probably night. We're arrived somewhere and we are in our space clothes, which are not the ones you usually see on a moonwalk. The are like overalls. They may be orange, but I'm not quite sure. It's a night landscape. Pebbles on the ground. And I say, Oh, my God, I didn't pick my video camera. And a woman I am walking with, one of the astronauts, says: Oh, don't worry. See all those packages? There are a lot of packages standing there. They must have packed it somewhere. She says, Look, those are the only speakers! My God, they are so expensive. They are, I say. They must take a lot of abuse in outer space. We come to a place that is like an ongoing patio in this intermediate station on the moon. She says, as if she suddenly remembered something, Oh, come, I'll show you the place where it all started. She takes me by the hand and runs me over to a cave. We come in the cave and I somehow know what's going to happen. Somehow I know it. The transformation happens immediately. We are waltzing. And we're clearly in the nineteenth century. We've traveled back in time but I don't realize it at the moment. Although on the other hand I do know. She has late-nineteenth-century clothes and I wear tails. The room is large. Everybody around is waltzing. I say in broken German, Madam, I want to marry you. She answers in the same broken German with an English accent: Yes, I also want to marry you. I know there is something strange. Then it is as if she is an actress; yet I know that we are in the nineteenth century. And suddenly everything changes. People at gas stations with dirty T-shirts and I remember the word Euro-pants: floppy pants with suspenders. We're back in some kind of town in the twentieth century, somewhere in the American Midwest or Texas. It is a tremendous shock, though I know that it is happening. But still the transformation is a tremendous shock. This is a mission that is going on having to do with working on dreams. The mission is something like in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.

3442,,,,,Male,ID: rb_dreams:rb details,01-14-2013,"Home 41. I have a meeting with an attractive man, Jerry, who showed me the night life of a large Australian city. We were with three friends. We're in a car. A white old American clunker. My night-life guide is driving on the right side of the car. I am already telling him about being in two worlds at the same time. He understands perfectly. We have a very good communication. I sit in the passenger seat on the left. The otehr two may be in another car. I have things with me that I have to send back home. I'm very surprised that I am in two places at the same time. He and two of his friends are going to take me out to meet with black women friends of theirs with whom we will have sex. At first we come to a room where women are baking. Their skin looks like bread. Or more like a souffle of egg white. It is very steamy, sweaty and hot. One of the women is suddenly coming under water and her head shrinks. Something like the wicked witch of the west in The Wizard of Oz, but different. Not threatening. Then there are some things I have to send back home to the other world. We go to a post office where they ask me for identification. My driver's license has no picture on it. I can see the photo actually disappear as I am showing it to the man behind the counter. They will make a photograph and put it on the passport so I will have an identification in this world. I say to my night guide: This is just the same as in other stories you hear about ghosts. Meaning that they have no face, no reflection in the mirror. It almost looks like a temporary post office. I am in two places at the same time. I am in America and I am here in Australia and that is impossible. He nods; he knows the problem. he tells it to his friend in a language I do not understand. So I have to send these things back home and have to pack them and put them in a box. The box is on the right side of the post office. But I cannot take the wooden box that stands there. I have to get another box and my friends are leaving. I do not want to miss the sex, so I say to the post office clerk that I will leave it here and will come back, because in this double life I can do anything without being found out. I feel completely without responsibility. So I run after them down a hill and don't see them. It is a low building and houses are connected in a small settlement. I run around to find them. There are parties going on everywhere. Young people like on the Vineyard. It is seven in the morning. A man comes up to me who has been living in Japan for three months. I say Japan is a great country. We are in Japan. Then I see my friends again, the three men. I am very happy. I hope we will now get to the place. Then I begin to lose the reality. I try to hold on to it, but it fades. I wake up. While I am in this other life I do an experiment. I close my eyes and imagine that I am in this other life. This experiment is very different from actually being there, because when I open my eyes, everything around me is totally real. And I feel it and I know it and I can touch it and it is completely and totally real. Yet when I imagine it with my eyes closed it is still wispy and not real. So the difference between recall and actuality remains the same in the dreamworld as it is in the physical world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3443,,,,,Male,ID: rb_dreams:rb details,01-14-2013,"Home 39. We are in a house that has a very difficult passage. You had to wring yourself through a very narrow part near the stairwell. We are in Holland at the wedding of my best friends. I sit at the head table next to the groom's mother and across from his father. Across from me there is a black woman. First there is a needle sticking out of her skin. Then I feel a needle stick out of my skin as well. Something further sticks out under the eye. A kind of jack, of the game jacks. Then I take a jack out of my mouth. It is one with four sides. More and more jacks come out of my mouth. It is happening to the black woman as well. In the beginning the groom's parents are amused. But then they begin to find it awful. They say, Robbie, this is crazy, this is going too far. You can't do this. This is ridiculous. Terrible. They get up. I run away from the table and go somewhere. I see the bride. She is upstairs. Now there are no longer jacks in my mouth. She is dressed beautifully. She is wearing a gown of old silk. It shines beautifully. It has a light ivory color. It also looks a little like taffetta. I bow to her and she laughs. She is surrounded by all of her bridesmaids. Then I find a map. A very ancient map. I am now someone else. A blond fellow student with a classical Latin surname, whose father had been an ambassador with a home on a Greek island. I/he find(s) the map. There is a drawing in it. And the drawing has a square with an X inside, an onion-shaped dome on top. The whole picture reminds me of an hourglass. he walks with this drawing through many adventures. Many things happen that he has to get through. And in the end he comes back to the wedding with the scroll under his arm. he has been able to hold on to the scroll through all his trials and tribulations. But it is all over now. He is terribly ashamed for all the mess he has made there. The long tables are empty and the chairs lean against them. It is really a feeling of after-the-great-party, which has been missed entirely. Then he goes over to the river and sits on the grass. Suddenly he sees to his left, on the riverbank, a building. The building is exactly, but exactly, the drawing he has carried with him through all these trials and adventures. It reads on it in Dutch: This is the design/blueprint of the world. He looks at it and I stand next to him. He sees it and it is fantastic to behold. And then it immediately becomes very old. It disappears, entirely decayed, out of this world. It looks like the whole building is driving off; it goes away. I tell him: I hvae enormous respect for you that you have done all this! Because it really was there. You held on to the image. Because you did it like you did, you've been able to hold on to the image. The image was really present. The building has truly existed. Nobody knows it but you. You've kept the image. You know it. And I don't believe that I'd have ever been able to do so. I already got scared when things went wrong at the table with the jacks in my mouth next to my parents. I already found that a terrifying experience. The building had been made of wood; old wood. It was a geometrical form. At first when it was new, it was very beautiful. And then it very quickly became old. Because it was all long, long ago. A certain game was played before the wedding. Someone went through a certain transformation all the time. Because suddenly I saw him sit somewhere as a dressed-up animal. Something to do with an elephant. The game had to do with the notion that everything had meaning and everything was meaningful to a ridiculous degree. I am amazed that he kept it all going. That he actually kept going so he would finally see the building. The Entwurf. It was like a mill where grain was pounded. Very ancient; very, very ancient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N., a college friend, hurried up to me and said P. had come to the show with some other girls from LEC (P. was the girl my date had gone steadily with at LEC). The fact that she had come did not bother me but I did not want her to see me when I got dressed into my street clothes. It seemed that I had a fur coat similar to hers and was afraid that she would accuse me of having stolen it.

The night of the dance I received a pink camelia, but it was not as beautiful as I expected, so I was disappointed. I remember that it was 9 o'clock that evening, and the fellow I was going with had not come for me. I tried to call Milt because I was certain that he would go. I was unable to reach him for a long time. It seemed like I was calling him by long distance, and I was sure the operators were listening to us, when I finally got to talk to him. He came right away, but we didn't go to the dance. I seemed to have forgotten all about it. He surprised me very much slipping a diamond ring on my finger. I had no idea that he was going to propose to me. He told me all about the house which he had almost finished building. I remembered that he had started it 6 months ago, and when I asked him why it was started to long ago, he turned his head away and looked a little bit ashamed, telling me that he had started it for some other girl. I didn't feel jealous though. We were both extremely happy, and talked for a long time making plans. The setting of the dream was not too clear. I think the last part was somewhere near my home.

The bride to be informed me that the ring was on a table near the altar and I was to pick it up before the service. The processional started and I followed the maid of honor down the aisle.

The bride became frantic as she looked for the ring. Then I suddenly stood up and shouted, ""Here it is.""

I remember I only had on tennis shoes and therefore couldn't go with them. I rationalized that I would stub my toes with these thin tennis shoes. Therefore I stayed to prepare art work for the children because I knew the head teacher wasn't capable of it. As I was doing my art work (making balloons for them to color) 2 or 3 girlfriends appeared and we began to play cards. In the midst, my mother-in-law called to ask if we were having fun.

The store was divided into two partitions--a front room and a back. I was in the other or front room and the proprietress of the shop was showing me various antique articles in which I had no particular interest. I know the proprietress quite well. She exists in real life--a middle aged woman who has gray hair and is somewhat deaf. In my dream either I specifically asked for or she volunteered the information that she had some very fine antique jewelry for which I really have a passion. Garnet jewelry is my special weakness. In my dream I asked eagerly to see it and she conducted me to the inner or back room. The only furnishing I recall was an antique desk with a great many pigeon holes and small drawers. She then left me alone and I heard her shut the door. I pulled open a little drawer and a vast quantity of jewelry--necklaces, bracelets, earrings and brooches--tumbled out. They were all of garnets set in antique gold and I coveted them more than anything else I ever saw. I fondled them greedily and I decided that, since I was alone in the room, I would take them. I was about to put them in my pocket when I experienced a definite feeling of wrong doing. I felt that the Virgin was looking down and disapproved. (I am no Catholic.) I put the jewelry back in the drawer and as I did so I noticed that the stones had undergone a radical change. The deep red of the garnets had become gray--colorless--lusterless. They were nothing but granite pebbles set in gold. Even before I woke up I felt that I had passed a sort of religious temptation test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I debated whether I could crawl up and was afraid not. Once someone threw in the window a jelly bomb, it was yellow. It didn't seem to have much effect. This fight had started after the backroom had been set afire. I forget why. I was told to throw water on it as everything was probably killed by now and there was a row of animals charred, but I don't think they were dead. I was a little frightened. There was a burnt crow and I think the other animals were birds also, perhaps vultures.

I reached into my mouth to examine it more closely and discovered it was extremely loose. As I tugged on it, I accidentally pulled out my entire lower left jaw bone. The teeth, however, remained in perfect order inside my mouth. Calmly I washed the blood off the jaw bone, which incidentally resembled that of a parrot beak calf whose picture I had noticed the day before in my genetic book. After the bone was clean, it very definitely assumed a different color and shape. It looked as though it were now made of pale blue painted wood, half my own size, and shaped like a rod about 1 inch diameter twisted around and around in loops. Tied to it was a piece of blue satin ribbon. I remember feeling very guilty about what the dentist would say when he found out I had removed my own jaw bone. Then the thought of how angry my mother would be occurred to me. Therefore, I folded the blue jaw bone in half and hid it in my closet. I knew that the dentist would have to pull my teeth since they were not held firmly in place by the jaw bone. So once again I reached into my mouth and ripped my bottom teeth out all in one strip. Again I washed them off with water and noticed with surprise that they were filled with tarnished copper--not silver at all. I was also amazed when I discovered none of the teeth had roots, but instead were held in place by little copper plates. Again I felt very guilty. How could the dentist fit me with false teeth when I no longer had a jaw bone? Suddenly I looked once again in the mirror and found with great relief that all my teeth were back inside my mouth. I remember thinking to myself that all this was only a dream and soon I would wake up.

I walked along the river bank until I saw faster and clearer water. I reentered the river and began to fish again. I had no luck and was about to go further up river when I saw two fishermen coming down the river. They came up to me and I saw they were two friends of mine about 28 years old with whom I frequently go fishing. I asked them whether they had caught any fish and they answered yes. I asked them if they would give me some bait and they said it was all gone. It then began to rain and we began to run back to town. The path was very straight and lined with trees. We hardly got wet.

The farther end was a great ways off, but I could see light in the distance. Also I could hear music. As I continued walking the sound of cascading water drowned out the music. I found that the tunnel opened into a marshland which was strewn with large rocks or boulders. I climbed upon one of the boulders, whereupon I noticed that there were several lead soldiers strewn over it. I tried to line them up in military fashion but the constant slapping of the water over the edge of the rock knocked them over. I put them in my pocket (shirt) and started for a house (which appeared unaccountably) but I seemed top heavy and stumbled and fell into the water.

I was a little provoked at my roommate's messy habits of leaving everything lying around in a chaotic manner. Despite this I was happy to remain there. Finally my roommate decided to leave because it was so desolate. I should have been sorry to see him go, but I felt glad to be left alone in this small house. I remember that it was hard to get to and from this place, because of a marshy area that had to be crossed. After my roommate left, I took life easy and actually was very happy loafing. Then people began to come back to see me, children mostly. They wanted to see how I was.

The woman reached in the drawer and very tenderly lifted out the 88 keys of the piano which were all tied together in one long string. They all began to weep.

I went out into the field before me which extended about 40 yards before the ground level rises to form a hill. It seems that the enemy was located on the other side of the hill. I was very frightened, in a feeling of helplessness more than real fear. I no sooner started out than I could see the enemy beginning to advance. I quickly went back to the rest of the group to stand off the attack. I took my rifle and began shooting at the enemy. I shot them with no effect and I found that I had not taken the safety off the gun. Now I was out of ammunition, as I borrowed some from the soldiers around me. Now when I shot, the advancing enemy would be killed. The other soldiers now seemed to be doing very little and I was defending the whole group. The enemy soldiers would almost get to me and I would kill them. I had no moral compunctions about killing them, but a feeling of to kill or be killed, along with a feeling that they were making me kill them. Finally I had killed enough so that the remainder retreated. As soon as the enemy retreated, three men came up to me and said to one another, ""this is the one,"" pinning a medal on me. I felt good but that turned to fear, like now every one of the enemy would be out to get me. Our group then retreated back to our house. A new group of the enemy attacked from the rear, but I saw them soon enough to give warning and avert a surprise attack. At this point I killed a man with my bare hands (a knife that is).

This is how I figure to 'grow' the eggs into tiny 1"" frogs. It seems like a very quick process, too! Maybe it takes a couple hours?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3854,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"Very simple slice of life dream among other dreams last night. Many forgotten. But here I am up to 7 ~ close to record number recorded in a day ~ and this is all I retained: The sun is shining super brightly. It's about 10/10:30 in the morning. I think: Yes! I want to go out in the sun! I really want to BASK in the sun, to go in the hot tub. To soak up some warmth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3855,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"I'm in my house, probably not this specific home, but a house which represents where I live. Slice of life dream until.... I'm indoors at back of my house, let's say in living room, looking outside thru a large picture window. Just in that moment I realize that the whole backyard view is endless water. Lake. There's a large, glorious lake vista just feet from my back porch. It's a marvelous moment: My mom is standing next to me, on my left. I tell her how I hadn't realized I had waterfront property. I'm increasingly elated at the realization. And I'm happy, too, my mom is here with me. I use her to bounce my thoughts, to explain my awakening. I tell her how I had wanted more; always wanted a lake house, a cottage on a lake. And how I never knew it was here all along! Just as I'm opening my eyes to this new reality, like Dorothy in Wizard of Oz, commenting on 'It's been here and I never noticed' the rolling waves begin to hypnotize me. I notice every detail. Maybe Mom suggests putting salt at shoreline to create less frothy foam. Maybe this makes me think about national anthem lyrics: From sea to shining sea? Then I notice a couple boats, ships. The first is smaller, but SO CLOSE it looms large. I see the captain who looks like an actor possibly of stature the likes of Jack Palance or Gary Cooper. Behind, baring down and to left of this boat is a big ship, like a freighter. The boats begin to come in view, multiplying until there are a dozen or two. All along I'm commenting to Mom about my surprise which starts as pleasant and evolves into overwhelming and stunned. Some people enter my home: Actors. Maybe it's the sea captain; I thought he was an actor! There are also 1-2 children, at least one young girl. I look at her T-shirt or other clothing/ item which has writing on it. The letters are a strange alphabet. Not Cyrillic nor Asian nor Arabic. I watch a few letters begin to morph, each one changing to 1-2 English letters to form a word. But what does it say? At first guessed it might be Tampopo, name of another, older movie. But not quite. I never do quite make out name of movie. The show/ story evolves. Doesn't seem like Mom's next to me, now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There's a lawn sprinkler, the 4-arm kind which spins and shoots water up as it circles. Somehow a long piece of fabric, like a very long scarf, has become wrapped around the base of sprinkler and is being twisted. As it circulates, the scarf shortens and strangles mechanism. I can see that only 2 of possibly 4 sprinkler/ faucets are shooting water. But there's more. Sprinkler seems to be digging itself into the ground, almost like a drill or auger. I want to fight against its sinking. It's possible there's something right below the surface which the water and intense action is churning up or down. Something like a dog or even a person, again, struggling to NOT be buried in the muddy ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I take them out and try to match them up in 'sets', like 4 same here, 6 alike there. Another bit involves finding small nesting bowl set. Set has small, clear pink glass insert for 3"" round china or metal bowl, with thin metal wire pop-in handle. Type of knick knack in which you'd put a 2"" votive candle. These 3 pieces fit together; I find them on the top of a bookcase-style bed headboard. Just for decor, and without candle. Later, something about selling the house & contents.

Doors on both stalls are rickety and with gaps along front so I feel somewhat vulnerable and exposed. Feels like curious eyes can easily peer in from cracks or over top of stall. I'd made an ENORMOUS poo and must step out of stall to get a stick or something to break it up. Or it won't flush. Upon returning a young woman tries to enter stall thinking I'm done. I tell her I'm not... or 'Get out!' Also, sense a man is peeking over the top. I accidentally drop parts of elaborate wedding gown I'm wearing into toilet bowl. Gown's lacy trim collar, and bodice like a vest, come off and fall into poopy toilet. I quickly pluck out the wet & lightly soiled dress parts. Disgusting.

Since Evan & I are on the outs, it's an uncomfortable situation. Awkward! I mean, I don't really mind. I can eat ice cream anywhere with anyone. But when we both show up at this eatery ~ possibly at airport ~ Evan's quietly grumpy, arms folded across his chest He is NOT about to get over hard feelings today, and once again gives me the cold shoulder. Harumph! He's surprised and disappointed at being tricked and won't eat. Due to his bitter reaction, I'm not in mood to eat, either. But I see humor in how he views this 'gotcha' by Jeff.

The others are younger men and gals or I'm only woman. The man is looking for a lost pair of earrings, probably diamonds. Seems like he'd forgotten about them and once he remembered ~ maybe he was in process of moving ~ he became desperate to find the long lost item. He said he'd searched through everything, thoroughly. Our MISSION: To help find them. Possibly big reward. Some reward. We all search. I search through piles of bags, piles everywhere. It feels overwhelming, daunting. I know how he feels and think about how difficult it'd be for me to clean, discard, search, move. Ack. One of the younger guys finds a small rectangle box. Inside are small rectangle earrings with complex detail. Not right. Though I thought beforehand the missing earrings are probably in small rectangle box. Maybe another box is found; I see large square diamonds. Probably not real. And not right, either. I look thru everything, over and over. Inside envelopes and trash and more bags and piles. Begin to set some junk aside to throw out, old pieces of paper. Feels like going thru detritus of someone's life. Not an invasion, since we've been asked to help. Foreshadowing maybe. Overwhelming task to think about, though I know I SHOULD start to search/look thru, sort out. Stuff, mainly. Physically. But also Feelings.

Then out of his wet, brown lips I hear him taunt me saying the word: Stupid. It sounds like Jeff fed it to him, along with the candy. He says something like: No, YOU'RE stupid. It’s not enough that Jeff has Harry's full attention, he has to bribe him with treats and teach him to turn on me. Very pushy.

There are 2 men in car with us, possibly her age or, more likely, older. I stop the car in what's like a back alley, a side street off, say, Monroe Ave, near downtown. There's a little, muddy garden plot and maybe a small food stand selling fish. I see one fish on it. There's a little, old Chinese woman nearby. It's her garden, her fish. I see more fish near garden. They are still alive, flopping around. Possibly even with heads cut off, still reflexively moving. Abby or I hold a bag of chestnuts we had. But this woman also sells chestnuts, lovely huge ones. A few geese or wild turkeys gather near us, mildly/ aggressively poking about. We drop our chestnuts into the mud. We begin to pick them up as best as possible; I pick up 1 of the big ones. Probably not mine. I notice a flower pot with some new shoots: The woman is growing chestnuts. I ask if that's where Chestnut trees come from. It's a revelation to me, a satori. Ask her price of fish. It's around $2. I buy a headless one, not sure how to clean & cook it. But there in car I scrape it off the skin, exposing very thin filleted pieces. I offer it to the guys in back seat. Nobody really wants to eat it, though originally seemed like good idea. Turns out price might be $4 ~ per pound? Per fish? Still good price. But this fish didn't have much on it's skin/ bones. Pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's in a secret, deep place in the basement, a portal to the outside/ netherworld. There's running water about to BLOW! I'm with a man, but it isn't Jeff. New boyfriend or possibly old one like Alan O. I want him to fix it, want to be able to rely on him or anyone to deal with it, and to stop it. He can't because IF he blocks it up with gravel or boards it'll hide an obscure opening that looks into a place like a sports bar where something is being filmed or broadcast. Boarding hole up would compromise and shorten what is seen by viewers. So he tells me to get out fast! Will all my stuff be ruined? Yes, probably. I go around gathering up everything of most value ASAP. Seek and find my old, small grey leather suitcase. This small suitcase is very important to me in order to carry my most precious belongings. Here I have to reckon with my priorities: Mainly get jewelry of most value in dresser drawers, closet and hanging on bathroom mirror. First I pick them out piece by piece, eventually I quickly grab handfuls off mirror, pulling off big clumps at a time. I also choose one pair of shoes: flat, black loafers. Comfort seems paramount to me at this time. Then I think: Art! Most importantly art from 'small show' I was in featuring my Memory Sensory boxes (3) and corresponding short story/books (3) which covered experiences truly important to me. MY art. Oddly do not grab photos or albums. There's no reasoning, no accounting not taking something which'd probably be FIRST on my list. Only the memory boxes/ art is not in my bedroom.

I ask the man with big gut what his address is. He tells me something like 123 or 23 Charter. Charter what? Charter Oaks, I guess? Why can't he answer me directly? He's purposely vague. Does he live near us? In our 'hood? He's odd. He jokes. He's indirect. Gives his name as R. U. Fudge or Fudge Packer. I try to explain how important it is to know where Harry is. At first I felt safe letting Harry out of my sight to play with a kid. Now I'm scared! I follow the guy's older boy, about 8 years old, looking up to see a TERRACE of snow tunnels in next yard. They're beautiful but chilling, reminding me of recent news report where young local boy fell into ice fort and was barely pulled out. We continue walking up the street as parade of kids approaches. Three are playing various size saxophones. I say aloud, possibly to 8 year old, I wish I took sax lessons. Then I retract that statement. Maybe I just wish I could play an instrument. Finally I get to something like a Museum of Lost Boys. They're dressing up and playing 'Lost Boys.' Harry doesn't want to leave.

3865,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"Point I become aware of dream is when I'm standing on a crowded sidewalk near a public square, by a long/wide wrought iron fence, possibly in front of a celebrity's house. I'm with Abby &/ or Sarah, I think. It could be in NYC or LA or similar place where affluent celebrities live. Though later on it seems I'm in my own house, so I can't be sure. The fenced in mansion belongs to someone like Will Smith, or other mega-wealthy young, good-looking black movie star. I'm looking down on the sidewalk, where it meets the fence, and on the ground I spot a ring. The delicate band, probably platinum, is lying on its side. It's thin and thus easily overlooked. But when I pick it up, I see an unusually beautiful and unique setting holding a big diamond. Party in the front, business in the back. Immediately I know I should find the owner of the ring and return it. BUT, and it's a big but, I have mixed feelings. Assuming this very valuable ring belongs to celebrity, HOW do I find him? And if I find him, how do I contact him? Do I ask his posse? His secret service-like minions? So, I enter the park/square, like a brick piazza, where there are vendors probably selling street food and lots of people mingling outdoors. I look for someone who's in charge, a guy who knows a guy, who can put me in touch with the star. But I don't want to reveal that I have ring! Strange, unexpected things begin happening to me. First, for safe-keeping I put on the ring and find that I really like it! I begin to entertain notion of keeping it. Though I know guilt will get the better of me. I begin calculating how much I'd get for reward for turning it in. Is it worth it for $100? NO! $1,000, or more. Ok. Part of me knows I should be a good example for my girls. Still, ring is mighty gorgeous and suits me so well. I get slightly comfortable with it. Then dream takes weird turn: I'm with unsavory characters, possibly met while trying to contact celebrity owner of ring. These 2 guys do drugs. I go to my house or theirs, and I do something I've never done. It's like a bong put inside a small freezer. Steam or smoke comes out and I inhale very deeply over & over! The 2 dopers show me how to do it more efficiently, possibly sniffing it. Then cops come by heading for our place. They quit smoking BUT it leaves a light dusting of ash on freezer shelf. We give powder a swipe with our hands to rub it off. It smudges into tiny, sage-color dust bunnies they call ""Green Mice."" What the...?! Quickly I start washing everything down, getting rid of those teeny clumps or residue, afraid cops will test everything. These guys tell me it was cocaine, not weed. What the...?! I've never done cocaine. Doesn't feel different. Promise myself to never do it again. I'm PARANOID. I've gone from fear of handing the ring over to wrong person, to wanting to keep ring, to being caught/ arrested for doing dope. Slippery slope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3866,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"One main 'bit' in this dream is schtick about my ring ~ probably my engagement ring. It doesn't look like anything I own nor really like anything I've seen. It has 2 sort of wings with a modern flip in opposing directions. Like 2 convex waves not quite meeting in middle. There's a clear, arching tube between the 2 'waves.' It connects them, and it is filled with tiny sesame-like seeds. Weird. For some reason I'm extremely compelled to change/ alter the shape of this ring. I manipulate it until it softens and melds into a different shape. First I get the 'wings' to narrow and raise up. Eventually I flatten it out almost completely. Wait! I don't like how it looks. Was this a mistake? THEN I accidentally drop it in the kitchen sink, and it lands on the open/ wire drain top. Didn't quite fall in, and then it did! I let everyone in K know. Jeff, and Julie. Jeff says he'll ""be happy to help"" me get it out. That's code for: Don't tell me again and maybe I'll look at it eventually. It's possible Sarah & Canaan might be there, but if not then, soon. Julie runs water into sink, oblivious of my dire announcement. What?! Wait! I criticize her, my closest friend. HOW could you do that?! She's defensive, doesn't think she can do wrong nor hurt me. Says she used 'shower' function vs 'stream.' Yeah, well, it could still push it through TRAP! I go into frantic mode. Beg Jeff to please get narrow/flattened ring out NOW. He knows how to open sink drain trap. He takes of the elbow pipe, or maybe didn't need to go so far. Rescues ring! Then dream focuses on Sarah and Canaan both over and sitting in our family room, I guess. Possibly Jules is still in kitchen? Jeff, too. But I'm listening to Sarah & Canaan (and maybe another young person) talk. Sarah's telling Canaan there's a job opening at the hospital where Sarah works. She thinks Canaan should apply for it, it'd be good for her. It's like intake or welcome desk, something not too challenging, yet using Canaan's friendly skills. Also, in general, Sarah feels strongly Canaan should work. Cane agrees she might like this job, except she would NOT work where she couldn't bring Milo. Well, there might be daycare available. Nope. Not leaving him. We probably all wonder if that'll ever happen, or if she'll ever get a job. Discussion between my 2 girls continues like a ping pong game, quietly in distance. I hear it: Sarah's calculating how many more babies she'll have in say the next 3 years. Maybe 3-5 years. She'd like to knock out at least 2; probably 3 in total. It's sweet to hear them discussing this. Canaan sees Motherhood as the one true path. Sarah tries to incorporate work/ career into her path. Both are extremely integral to Sarah. Unlike Cane who only wants mommy track. But in this one instance they seem to be in tune, no one pushing the other's buttons. Five minutes of peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's the BIG change: Dad bought a miniature horse. A HORSE. She's (or he is) upstairs in parent's bedroom. She's quiet, docile. I don't think it's right or fair to have a horse indoors and not getting much exercise, let alone attention. Mom might be in bed, there, ignoring the German Shepard-size pony. Maybe she's watching the big console TV or listening to the radio, maybe dozing or 'resting.' I go in their room and shake things up, needle, push. Let me take Pony for a walk ~ is there a leash? I really feel they should get rid of/return the small horse. At least let me take the poor beautiful creature downstairs, outside, okay? I pet her, talk baby talk to her and start calling it 'Honey' because it is color of honey. Horsey responds to name, Honey. I bring her down to the dining room. Under dining room table pony appears even smaller, size of a small pug. She's quiet and stands still but moves her butt out in a way indicating to me, too late, that she's going to PEE. She'd backed up to something white on the floor, like a piece of paper. Maybe she's partially housebroken? Not enough. IF I were more prepared maybe I could work with it. Instead I rush to soak up the non-stop puddle ~ she pees like a racehorse ~ with a towel. Then throw down lots of paper toweling on the mini-lake on carpet under dining table. I think: It's NOT the small horse's fault; it doesn't belong indoors. Nor should it live in household with older people. Mom wouldn't want it, will ignore it. Dad's too old or busy to care for it properly. Next scene ~ after the endless peeing ~ I see the pony, even smaller, now lying down on its side in a terrarium-like bowl on top of dining room table. Like a turtle dish or small aquarium for lizards or fish. There's water in bowl so the poor little dog, still looking like a German Shepard but only about 6"" long, is lying in water up to her/ his neck. Very quiet, passive. It's a sad sight to me.

I turn my head to look at her; her cheeks, her face is wrinkled. I look at her open book to see what page we're on. I lean in next to her, practically on her lap, sharing her seat. Dream feels incredibly real and lucid. I tell myself, during dream, to take it in. This won't be forever, I think, reminding myself we won't be together again. From his seat, Dad reads something aloud to the congregation. It's an honor for him to say this piece, maybe an opening prayer, and everyone listens. He stops, reaches down to the floor to his left, rifles noisily through a bag, possibly his tallit bag, looking for something. He grabs a handkerchief or Kleenex. Blows his nose. Allergies, I think at first. Or emotion? A woman in adjacent section, on side, behind us ~ we're closer to front in our usual seats ~ stands to make announcements. But I can't hear her clearly. It's hard to understand what she's saying, though she's only about 10 rows away and facing us. If we can't hear her, who can?

I see myself up above a low tree canopy or shrubs like a broad hedge of evergreen bushes. I consider stepping out on them, weighing whether or not they'll hold my weight. They are cut flat on top and are of slightly varying height and color. Can I step and walk on them without falling through? Tentatively try; yes I can. Don't know if I felt pressure to take these steps or crawl out on the shrub tops but guess it was necessary possibly to escape or get away. Then, as dream continues, I find a cat and bond with her. She's cream color with peach markings or stripes. She's an unusual cat in that I'm not allergic to her AND she's cuddly. This cat leans against me, my chest, as I cradle her. She snuggles. It's remarkable and unexpected to me and others I come upon. I talk with someone or a couple people, commenting on the unusual closeness the cat has with me; an immediate connection. The other people examine the clinging cat to see if she's sick or possibly dying. I see her attachment to me as a deep need, and as love. Frankly, although I'm waiting for allergies and breathing problems to kick in, I'm comforted by the cat's unconditional, unexpected need for me.

When it's time to return home I must transport all my belongings. In trunks, I think. There are 2 separate sites: a campsite and another field/ area where a bus's being loaded up. My old pal Debbie Waltzer is the manager in charge of packing up group of young adult campers. I ask her if there's room for my stuff so I can get it home. There's room, but her group's already packed so if I want to load mine she reluctantly agrees. But I only have 2 minutes. I run like Hell. Run like the wind to my original camp site. So much stuff I can't possibly get it all back to Deb's bus in time! As I race back with whatever I can carry, I meet up with a friend's son. Possibly Lorie J's son, but this guy's name is Ryan, I think. This young man is in his 20s, very sweet and helpful. Runs with me, and agrees; he doesn't think Deb's fair nor realistic. He defends me emotionally, stands with me. I tell him I'll call Jeff to come pick up my stuff I couldn't carry back to Debbie's bus. But I wonder: How will he fit it all in his car or even in my SUV?

3871,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"Quite an odd dream about a tiny little worm-like reptile which grows and expands in water. It alternately was about 5"" long with remarkably sharp shark-like teeth. I didn't even notice it had teeth until it sort of clamped down and bit my hand or finger while I was holding it. It's part cute, part nasty and I decide I better give it away once I realize that it will continue growing indefinitely.   Is it starting to look like a trilobite? Ugh! Kind of gross. At first, I think, I take it out of the water ~ possibly the sewer ~ and let it shrink up on sidewalk. Down to resembling a 1"" black slug. Looks creepy ~ like a giant sperm ~ but less threatening. Guess Jeff's with me when I see a young, preteen boy. I offer him the small, possibly legless reptile. At first boy wants the weird creature and soon decides he shouldn't take it. Something regarding its teeth, it bites? Maybe because it'll grow? I'm kind of desperate for him ~ anyone ~ to take it. Killing or abandoning the little beasty isn't an option for me. Not yet. So I tell kid I'll find a box so he can transport the teeny monster pet. Jeff & I are competitive, looking for a box and wanting to be first to find it. I find a couple possibilities but realize they don't close perfectly, so little animal could escape and/ or bite the kid. We keep looking until I find something, probably cardboard, possibly metal ~ not wanting to give away a nice wooden covered box. I must get rid of small creature! Better to give away than let it die.

The stairs disappear as the smooth, wavy surface flattens out less like a rock climbing wall. Now it's just slippery and tight.

I said she could certainly put up another picture on one blank wall which still held a picture hook. We chatted for a while, then Deb said she had to go to work helping these young people.

She or they think there MUST be an opening, and indeed I keep trying to shove/ stuff a cloth or rag into a 4"" tube/tunnel to see how far it goes. But oddly there is no way out. In dream I'm feeling increasingly claustrophobic. I want out! Possibly the only way out is to walk back up and into/ through ½-way house where Deb is. But I haven't figured this out, yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3874,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"Action takes place mainly in foyer of 'our' home with Jeff. But it doesn't look like our house. We're discussing various mundane, household issues like about decorating, or simple slice of life stuff. a) First there are soap and/or lotion dispensers in dark brown plastic, a la 1970's style. I notice how well they match the long brown wall in foyer. But how OLD must this stuff be, the creams or products, being in vintage dispensers? Still good? Also, there's some man over, now or later. b) Jeff tells me about a younger man, a colleague or co-worker, maybe in his mid-40s. The guy uses special wrinkle cream for his neck. Jeff scoffs at this, belittles, mocks. He can't abide such vanity, such unnecessary extravagance. However, I'm thinking: Hmmm. Maybe I should get this! I'd use it in a heartbeat! But Jeff sees such people, especially men, as soft, shallow & self-absorbed. Jeff tells me he's bought a mailing plan for me. It costs about $15.15/month. He chose it without asking my needs. I feel it's TOO expensive! I argue that I don't mail as much anymore. He says I send a lot of packages. I tell him I'd need to mail 2 packages/ week to have plan pay for itself; to break even. He say I will. I say to him: ""I'm slowing down"" my business. Inside I'm thinking to myself: ""Wow. Ok. It's time."" I realize that lots of my friends are slowing down. Retiring. And I'm giving myself permission, subconsciously, to slow down. An epiphany. And it feels okay. A black man enters foyer from front door. He's middle aged/middle class, maybe a professor. He's well dressed in jacket or overcoat. He compliments our yard's NEATNESS commenting on how our HOSE is put away, out of sight. Huh?! I'm surprised, because one pet peeve is Jeff does NOT put our hose away nor hang it up. I even point it out to guy, showing coiled hose on front walk ~ mostly hidden by snow. See tell-tale hose?! And some of what the guy says rhymes, like ""Those/ Chose/ Hose"" though not sure it's intentional. It's almost Cat in the Hat, Thing 1 & 2 esque.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3875,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"I go to a small, old-fashioned grocery store like Village Fair in E. Rochester. They have big discounts. Maybe store is having a grand re-opening sale, or just some big specials. There's a feeling of excitement/ celebration happening inside. I pick up some small items I don't really need, like a little butterscotch lollypop for 10 cents. Prices too good to pass up. In produce department I see a couple shelves with 3 watermelons. They're supposed to be mini size ones, but they're the largest minis I've ever seen. Like small full-sized watermelons, and only $2 each. I waver between the 2 largest, but each has a flaw. One has a big rough bump on outside; other has a mirror-image divot/ concave spot, and is bit pale, yellowish. I pick up one, put it down, go for the other. A man, a fellow shopper, comes over and I know I need to decide. Feel pressured. Just pick one! Near 3 watermelons are some cantaloupes. Pre-sliced, but not like usual. These are sliced in 1/2"" thin slices while still attached at top end of lope. Does this make them too slimy or soft? They are kinda wet, but flesh still firm enough. Great price, too, so I pick one up. Possibly it's $2, too? I take a large package of ground meat, already wrapped in white butcher paper. It's long, size and shape of tenderloin or leg of lamb. Some big special deal, too. When I go to check out I notice the few older clerks are chatting, not paying attention. I ask a woman how/ where I check out. She says it's okay to go to that talkative older guy, interrupt him. I would've liked more attention, but I go. He's okay, chatty and quirky. He points out the values I got and encourages me to buy more of the cheap come-ons like candy. Maybe bonus points are involved. I consider whether/ not I want to take more time to get more. Maybe after I check out? I hand him a bill, which I thought was a $20, without looking. He's handing me change from $100. I wasn't paying attention. How casual I must seem to just hand $100 over! He gives about $60 back. He owes me around $2 in change and comments: You'll find something to buy, or you'll spend it fast. Like he doesn't need to give me the $2 because I could blow through it fast, there. But I don't want to feel pressured to find $2 worth of stuff. Maybe a couple more 10 cent lollypops? Instead, I DO keep looking, thinking maybe I'll look outside in store's garden area, and find some spices. I could get a new basil plant! But the garden is spare, not in season yet. Nothing I need. Maybe some yarrow or sage is growing? Pass. I'm about to re-enter the store and meet a woman who's also going back in. But instead of walking around to proper entrance, she shows me that we can go in by where her family is sitting at a table, inside. There's a big sliding door screen. One of her relatives, an elderly woman I think, is in a wheelchair. Maybe this gal thinks she's entitled to special privileges? Ok, well, I'll follow her in if it works. There's another bit within this dream/story: Canaan's there, comes or meets me later. We talk about plans for a dinner I've arranged. Although date was coordinated for everyone's convenience, she's now asking to change from a Saturday to Sunday or vice versa. Seems originally it ~ maybe place where we planned to go ~ was serving chicken which was fine with Cane. Now she called and found out they have something she likes better, say 'ribs' or something. She says: ""Oh well, Milo will only get a little diarrhea."" Like that's okay, and I won't feel guilty?! I think it's selfish and manipulative. But not surprised. I'll try to convince her to keep our original plans. It's easier ~ for me ~ not to reorganize with everyone. Still outside before re-entering grocery, I see an iPhone in a colorful, decorative case. Maybe it's ringing. I touch it and find a long, illustrated text with cool animations. Wow! Wish I knew how to do that. I feel my abilities are inferior, though I've dreamed up some cool image. Like a faucet turned on and steam/ smoke billowing down. Looks like someone's Family Newsletter full of information and cartoon graphics. Figure it's Canaan's phone, and text/ story is from a gay couple, guy friends of hers. I can't figure out how to close it, so I keep touching cell face until I realize I can push the off button. Don't want to ruin anything so I bring it to Canaan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3876,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"Thinking about getting a gift for Harrison and wonder what a bigger boy would like. Reason that it's easier to buy toys for young kids, like under 8. Come up with a great idea: Basketball pole! I consider where to install it, where it won't be too close to neighbors' house. Then it comes to me: Wait! There's an old backboard/ hoop on the garage! Now I picture it, but broken, the circle of the hoop broken, missing a net. So maybe let's replace the whole, old backboard. But the location is great ~ not too close to anyone's yard, on garage. And I think, in dream, yes and Harry likes shooting hoops. Perfect! We end up entering a very nice downtown restaurant, sort of old fashioned Roch classic, where you'd go for special occasions. As we walk into crowded dining room I'm SO surprised to see many of my relatives including Mickey, Larry & Maritta, Canaan, probably Sarah, too, and a small, slight, bald man wearing round/ oval wire rim glasses. Who is he? Some small bit involving him, but very minor. I'm drawn to immediately go say hello and hug my cousins, sibs, adult kids. What a great opportunity to introduce my friend (one of my closest African American friends). Also, I'm amazed they had the same idea I had, to go to this special place. But why didn't I know their plans, why not included? This feels a bit unsettling, though I don't begrudge them their good time. However, Cynthia continued walking to a china cabinet or buffet where she picks up a large, interestingly designed, colorfully enameled samovar or tea urn with many angles. She's attracted to it, and I don't want to be rude and push her to come with me. Though I want to introduce her to my family! By the time we walk a few tables back to them, most of my relatives have left. Huh?! Mickey and Larry left, probably Canaan, too. Not sure who's left but no one seems to know the 'Plan.' They don't know where they went. I'm thinking for ice cream? Maybe they'll be back? I'd try to find/ meet them if someone here knew where. I'm feeling left out, frustrated, irritated now. Miss them AND want them to meet Cynthia and vice versa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3877,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"MAIN dream: At an impromptu child's birthday party, I enter while it's already in progress. Jeff had set it up very simply for around 8 - 10 little girls about 2nd or 3rd graders. I look to see what he's organized, for food, to see if it's more than 1 item. Yes, I see french fries on the plates possibly with sandwich or burger. Simple, but adequate. I look around wondering if it's okay, enough. Yes, but bare minimum. I move further into house looking for a cake: In the kitchen? In the freezer? No. But then I see it! A HUGE sheet cake with mostly white frosting; a corner of one section has random patch of chocolate frosting. I wonder if cake is 1/2 chocolate and 1/2 white so I lift up some frosting to check. Not best looking cake, and way too big. A waste. But he did something, so I can't complain! There's a sense I'm rushing, running late. MY birthday party is next, coming up soon, somewhere else. I have to leave, get ready to meet MY friends. Need to ask Jeff whether or not he got a cake for my birthday, too. BUT must interrupt him while he's talking to a guy. Someone like Marty Robinson or Tommy Durkin. A tall, slender, older quietly intense/edgy guy. I'm sure the guy'll resent and be angry with me for interruption. And the implication that Jeff should help me out. I can tell this guy is not women-friendly, especially with me! Feel I must explain why I need to know if Jeff got cake for me. Also, I think: SO much cake! If only Jeff got 2 small ones, or if we could cut this sheet cake in half. What a waste for 8 little kids! I could've used half at my party. Well, this misogynistic guy thinks it wasn't vital for me to interrupt. Plus there's something re: Muslim or Islam, like at an elementary school with wood floors and small chairs. I go there with 2 small young girls with transitional guy, like Gary Friend. He takes me to meet with Imam, sort of undercover guy raised within Muslims. He hands me a clear, vinyl prayer shawl similar to a talit. And book of simple prayers, songs and with colorful photo cards glued on pages. I run my fingertip over the pictures to feel their slightly rough texture. I read the text, the quotes in page side bars. One says: Semen is sin. Stuff like that. Propaganda. It makes me sad. I tell Jeff or guy friend. It's time to sit and pray, but no seat available for me. The tiny girls find tiny chairs to sit on. I feel conspicuous but finally sit, possibly share a seat with a little girl who leans on me. I want to whisper: See? Referring to 'Sex/semen/women/everything is dirty' ideology. But the guy has mixed feelings; he sees both sides. Possibly another bit of connecting dream: I sense need to get dressed nicely for interview or Imam. Choose shoes, consider new gold/ bronze. I'd like to get use of them. Too flashy? Tone it down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3878,,,,,Female,ID: janet1:janet details,08-17-2012,"Grandpa/ Pop is over at my house, sitting quietly with me, as I watch TV. Milo and Harrison are playing, probably noisily, in next room. Pop and I are in a linoleum-floored family or rec room. My show is on and I miss what someone said so I rewind the DVR over & over. It's only a dumb show like 'The Nanny.' Something about family being taken or held in their home w secret cameras watching everything they do. Maybe Jerry Seinfeld is the protagonist dad ~ or is it Mr. Sheffield? He's always smiling and chipper despite hostage situation. Smiling too hard, inappropriately, I think. People would not smile so much if they didn't think someone was watching them. Like on TV. It's a nonsensical blend of old TV sitcom with touch of police drama. The TV woman, let's say Fran Dresher, is able to escape/ leave with the kids. Then she returns wearing a HUGE, long diamond necklace ~ like a small chandelier ~ on her neck and chest. She's over the top. I guess she thought if the hubby/ boss was trapped,why not live it up and take advantage and hit the bank account and buy jewelry?! And yet she returns! She could've run, escaped. Yet she returns, all jokey. This is what I re-play, her flamboyant entrance, over & over. What is she saying?! It doesn't really matter. I see the trapped man looking around room for something to use as a weapon. Hidden cameras follow his every move; the kidnappers have removed or dismantled any possible weapon like knives, umbrellas, sharp or hard objects. However...there's one thing. It's the solid block that a gavel would bang on a courtroom desk. Can work! Man unscrews it and possibly can use it to clobber the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Pa asks me when my show will be over. I realize he's been patiently waiting to watch HIS show. Of course! He tells me that he's won a lottery for being in a drawing for something worth $500. Tells me he doesn't want or need the item, say luggage or electronics or trip. But he wants to see his show, and still would like to win. What does Pa want? He asks for a tea kettle, do we have a kettle? Yes! Mom ~ his middle daughter ~ always had one on the back corner of the kitchen stove! I picture it, in dream; it's chrome, possibly Farberware. I go to get it for Pop as it's right there in the family room, possibly on a second stove or hearth. One of my grandsons enters the room and I look up for split second. In that moment Pa is gone! Vanished. All I see is a tiny dust bunny on the floor where he'd been. I get up and pick up the chrome kettle, exactly as I recalled from Mom's 209 kitchen. Then I go to hall near where kids were playing and find Pa coming from kitchen with different kettle, possibly red kettle. Ahh. All's well. Back in TV room, while Pa's probably settled in with his show and his cup/ glass of tea, I find 2 small photo books I'd made with or for Sarah & Abby when they were quite young when homemade photo books first came out. They're covered with colored Saran Wrap. One is pink. One is lavender. Books are thin, paperback. One says ""Dor"" on cover with my aunt's photo from about 20 yrs ago. Pa's baby. She's serious, unsmiling. I figure that's what photograph suggested. I see pix of other women from Dor's era, equally deadpan expression. I see every detail in this already complex and emotional dream: One of the girls, either Sarah or Abbs, had written a note on front cover, without thinking it'd remain. Also, I look thru second book. It's of no one we know, only young female celebrities & singers. Like Brittney, Amber, Christina, maybe. Some I couldn't recall, today. Pix are in several sizes from full page, at first, then few per page, then pages become blank pages with assorted shrinking sized blank boxes. Clearly we didn't know what we were doing, how to upload, etc. What a waste. Later I give these 2 books to one person (Seinfeld?) and make a 3rd to give as well, because he or someone has 3 girls now. One each. Back to Pa. I'm glad he's here. It's a quiet, close, comfy visit. Milo enters room, approaching Pa. Pa kisses Milo on the head, or on face or lips. It's the sweetest gesture to ME. Connection. Validation that he sees, he's here. Shows that he knows ""my boys"". Feels so real. The visit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have explored this place and always know where I want to go when I'm there, I have ended up swimming, rafting, getting on the bus, getting on the train, roaming the halls of buildings there, riding a dirt bike out in the mountains, getting in perilous situations but always have a grasp on the fact that I am just back there visiting and so it's always an adventure, I have tried to draw maps of this place and know it like the back of my hand. Also, usually I am exhausted by the time I wake up.

I had been feeling a sinking feeling for a few months that I was going to die soon. I spent the day cleaning up my apartment. And just before I went to sleep, I verbally asked my Grandmother to help me if she could, and that I would like to live if there was anything I could do to help in the future. I 'awoke' walking from a dark hall into a brightly lit room with diffused light I couldn't see the source of. I walked in with a very tall, white robed person with flowing hair. There were 2 sets of 2 chairs facing each other offset from each other. The person in front of me, sat down and turned from me so I could not see who he/she was. Then after a moment, a child of like 10-11 in overalls came in followed by a woman of about 30 with a very pronounced swooped bangs hair style. They sat down, with the child in front of me. She looked angrily at me and put her knees to her chin and looked down to the floor. The woman was talking to me, but I couldn't hear her. I was looking at her and was thinking, 'Where do I know you from?' and then the swooped hair, and back to her face again, back and forth from hair to face,for like 20 seconds. All of a sudden I remembered having seen a photo of my Grandmother only once in her early 30's nearly 10 years before just after she died. And it looked like her. I blurted out, ""You're my Grandma!"" She burst into a smile and stood to hug me. Just as we hugged, boom, I was back in my body, awake and breathing hard. I went back to sleep. I awoke sometime later. Unable to breath. I have sleep apnea, and was choking on mucus, and couldn't get a breath. I heard in my head really loud, ""Stand up!"", I had no problem with doing that and did. I then heard, again in my head ""Breathe out!"" But I said in my mind, ""But that is counterintuitive."" and once again, in a more exasperated tone heard, ""Breathe out!"". I thought, ""Well if I am going to die anyway, there is nothing that will will make a difference."" I did breathe out and punched a small hole through the mucus, enabling me to get a small amount of air and eventually breathe normally. Afterwards, I was saying over and over again, 'Thank you Grandma'.

I and someone else I knew in the dream, we?re in a war situation, we get into a two sitter spaceship and we fly out to another vessel like a space station ? it was an orbit around the planet and we were nearly there and someone on the orbiting vessel operated a suction device aimed at us and I have a sense I know who it is that?s operating it and they?re on our side but they?ve got it wrong as to when to operate it, there?s a slight sense that while I?m frustrated I?m not entirely surprised that they?ve made a mistake. The canopy on the vessel I?m in breaks away and is sucked up, I?ve got lots of bits of stuff that gets sucked into the orbiting vessel, including stuff that was floating near the vessel. From our ship our dog is sucked up and I?m concerned that he might hit against some of the other stuff in the stream being sucked out or he might hit his head on the edge of the hole he?s sucked into, and there?s a vague sense that he doesn?t get hurt as I don?t see him getting hurt, then there are several other small living creatures from our ship (all the same species, the size of a hen, not sure what they were, I knew though in the dream and wasn?t surprised they were on board), then I and the person with me are sucked into the orbit vessel. A bit vague, I?m inside, it?s a high-tech built station or vessel, the two of us plus other people who are on our side, I?m leading a running fight, we move through the ship and fighting as we go and we?re holding off the enemy, we?re hosing them with liquid from hoses attached to our backpacks and the liquid is Channel and I have some uncertainty about how or why it works so I?ve been spraying it across the corridor back and forth and I deliberately experiment it by holding the hose directed at just one person and they collapse, possibly die, and I feel regret about that and some of those we?re fighting are humans and some are waist high yellow robots and my spraying is effective against them as well. Some robots are on our side and one of the enemy robots comes up to me and stands beside and either I or someone on my side has been nice to it so it will be loyal to us and fight for us. The enemy seemed to be spraying us with a liquid but I don?t seem to get hit or affected by it. We?re trying to get to the leader of the enemy who?s a woman and her main cronies and the passage way leads us to an opening which is like a cave with stone walls (not built) and it?s possibly open to the sky at the top so my feeling is that we?re on a planet. My sense is that they?ve arrived recently and materialised through some sort of magic, she?s dressed in black with red accents or symbols and she?s possibly the incarnation of a bad goddess, she one of the pantheon ? I know this because this is a variant of a previous dream ? she and her cronies are performing a ritual and she explains to them and has diagrams and pictures as well that there will be a black button and it may appear in one of three states ? one is where it is just slightly raised, one which projects quite high and I?m not sure what the third one was. She explains what would happen if it?s pressed for each position and I?m slightly confused as to which does what and she?s very confident that a particular one will appear and that she will press it and be reconfirmed in her role as the incarnation of the bad goddess and I?ve a sense that this will make her even more powerful and that she will defeat us. A button appears and it?s fully raised quite high, I?m not sure what it does and I wish out loud that I had a copy of the diagram but there?s a general wish towards it and I push together with the others to try to get to it because I want to stop her from pushing it. I get shoved, I lose my balance and I land with my hand pushing the button. Next thing I?m standing a short distance away on a platform ? I have a sense of being elevated ? and I?m wearing the black and red armour so I?ve become the incarnation. As I realize it, I say ?oh, no!? and I?m briefly dismayed that I?ve become evil but then I think that I?m still me so I can choose how to act and I won?t be evil so this situation is a way of neutralising this power. I order everyone to hold fire and there?s a sense that I expect my people will obey me because I?m still their leader and her people will obey me too ? not sure if it?s because I?m now the incarnation of her or because I?m very powerful and they might be afraid of me. I issue another order, again it?s a good order, but my manner is very autocratic and I thought that I?m becoming like the person she was and taking on the attributes of the bad goddess and I?m concerned about this because it has threatening implications for the future. The end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4101,,,,,Male,ID: harris_youth_2011:12970 details,05-03-2011,"To start off telling about this dream I need to give a little background information. I am currently (in real life) working on a novel which takes place with humans on another planet about 1000 yuears from now. Also important in the novel is that earth died out about 500 years before it takes place. The dream took place on this planet and I was one of the many biologicaly engineered organisms that had its origenal DNA cloned from humans then fiddled with so I and the others like me had wings two hearts better eyesight and more. I had escaped from the lab where I had been kept and made it to a remote lush ""forest"" near a valley. The valley had a city built in caves in the near-vertical sides. I continued hiding in the forest and met a girl from the valley gathering supplies. We became aquainted and she said if the people in the valley found out about me I'd be reported instantly as I was an unholy mutant. She went back to the valley and that same day the scientists who had made me along with authorities flew in and began questioning the residents of the valley if they had seen me. They stayed in the valley for a while and as I watched from the edge of the cliff about ten feet away from the forest line someone on the other side spotted me. That's when I was rudely woken and had to get ready for school. Throughout this entire dream I felt a warm joy and contentedness. I had not been or do not remember ""thinking"" during this dream. Notice how during this dream I had almost completely kept away from humans. That is most likely because in real life I am sick and tired of the sad excuses for the ""best"" being on earth called ""humans"" and I am sick of their sociaty and culture. Congradulations you have just been insulted and by a hypocrite too. :D (sarcasm)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dreamed that I was having a hard time getting to school because of the storm. It was my annual test week so I was really concerned about being late. My parents were driving my sister and me to school (which was strange because we walk to school...we live across the street from school). So there were down trees which made it hard to get there. My dad would go one way and the road would be blocked so he would try something else. It was crazy. Finally we got there and we were actually early. Everyone was relaxed and laughing acting like it was a normal day. I then woke up to the sound of the tornado sirens! This dream was Thursday night.

I was walking home from a brick middle school with my best friend Cori. Suddenly we started walking through a huge neighborhood of sinister-looking people. I told Cori to stay on the side of the road and not make eye contact because the people didn't look safe. Two men walked up to us one about twenty-five perhaps and the other around thirty. They looked to be the most frightening of all so Cori and I started racing away. The men began to follow us. The majority of the dream was running through our neighborhood turning corners and having the men almost catch us and try to kidnap us but shaking them off. Finally we girls had the sense to board a nearby school bus so we could safely get back to our school and alert the authorities about these men. When we got off the bus to the school the men were somehow still pursuing us and we could see that they were about a quarter of a mile away. We rushed into the school and told our female principal about the men chasing Cori and I. The principal Mrs. Carpenter told us to hide behind her desk. As the two men hustled into the school office they saw Cori and I behind the desk. As they were walking towards us Mrs. Carpenter picked up a gun and was about to fire it at the men when I awoke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had a dream where Sasuke (from the anime Naruto) and I were fighting against his evil brother Itachi in the countryside... When it started to rain rain rainbow gumballs. After that I found myself frantically running through a hotel with my brother and sister but separated from Sasuke. We ran though the hotel evaded Itachi by taking the elevator and found ourselves in the basement. My siblings and I ended up in the back of the hotel with coincidentally looked like the back of a Home Depot. I searched around for a place to hide and found a giant flowerpot and hid my brother and sister under it because I was afraid they were going to get hurt. With urgent instructions not to leave I then ran across the lot jumped from the edge of it (it was raised at a higher elevation) and jumped across a highway where I proceeded to hide in the open behind a building. There really wasn't any other places to hide but I probably could have found a better place to hide... The dream ends there too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Asian or Pacific Islander,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4137,,,,,Male,ID: harris_youth_2011:26524 details,05-03-2011,I was wandering through a house that felt distantly familiar due to its kitchen's similarity to my old home's kitchen. There was no one in this dream besides me and as I approached a door that led outside from this familiar kitchen I noticed that it had the same exact lock as my bedroom door. This triggered me to become lucid or conscious of my own dreaming. I felt magnificent at this point having achieved enlightenment on the fact that I was sleeping and could do what I wanted. I had no idea what was behind the door so I instead willed a huge grassy meadow surrounded by upstate New York forest into existence behind the door. I opened the door - lo and behold the scene I'd imagined was there. I took two steps onto the old rickety porch that appeared and I willed myself with my mind to begin rising. At first I rose relatively slowly into the air at about 30 miles per hour then at around 50 feet up I rocketed myself over the landscape at the speed of a jet ecstatically taking in the landscape as my brain generated more and more of the beautiful forests and streams. The experience was true freedom. After a few moments of this I fly down into the trees willing a monster into existence for me to practice fighting and making up powers for me to use. I begin losing lucidity at this point and the dream becomes vague but I remember some detail. The monster was around 8 feet tall and somewhat like an octopus. I thought to use some type of plasma projectile that came from my hands and the dream ended with me throwing these balls at the monster. I was 14 when I had this dream and I was staying in a cabin with my friend at the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4139,,,,,Female,ID: harris_youth_2011:26391 details,05-03-2011,One of the dreams I had that stood out the most to me was one I was not present in. Instead I was viewing as an omniscient entity. I had this dream at the age of 14 and I really enjoyed it. I won't detail it too much because the small facts won't be as important so I will just give the best summary I can. It was about a battle between two godly beings. One of them represented justice and Earth while the other was a celestial being who wanted to take over the universe. The justice godly being actually seemed like a normal boy and he had a girlfriend and other friends to cheer him on in the battle for universal domination. The celestial being worked with a living doll and because her owner was losing the battle she wanted to help him win somehow. The gods' powers were represented by how big and pretty their wings were and because the doll loved her owner very much (and he was more than just a master to her) she sacrificed her life to give life power to her master. Her life power was so huge that it increased her master's wings span (and prettiness) so much it was off the charts! He never noticed her sacrifice until he looked over to where she last stood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Asian or Pacific Islander,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my dream I was the same age but I wasn't a girl I was a boy whose name was Josh and I had this cylindrical thing on my back with a lightsaber coming out of the top; I think that this allowed me to fly. One night (in the dream) some aliens came and carried me away; this happened twice and I don't remember what happened the first time. They said that their master wanted someone with a ""saber"" like mine. The place where we arrived was very strange it was like I was sitting on space. But then I went to sleep in this place and dreamed that the aliens' master was really horrible and scary; when I went to meet him he said and I quote ""PUT HIM IN SHACKLES!"" And then these things I guess they were shackles attached to my ankles. Then he went outside and I woke up from the dream that I dreamed I was having (it was a dream within a dream). Finally I was taken to their master for real; I don't remember his name but he was actually very nice. He started testing me and last of all he asked if I did biological studies everyday. I told him that I did geography with my mom. Then all of the aliens were incredibly happy and there was clapping and shouts of joy. I told their master that I didn't do it everyday but the aliens were still happy. Then I saw a sign that said ""WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT CHINA JAPAN EUROPE AND ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD."" And then the aliens let me go; as soon as they let me go I wasn't Josh anymore I was just myself. Then me and my two sisters went out to go and get our bicycles from the shed in our backyard (it was there in real life too). While we were getting them I saw this lego character called Vladek from the ""Knight's Kingdom"" set (he is the villain in this lego set). Somehow when I was him I knew that he wanted to turn me and my sisters to the ""dark side "" like in Star Wars. So I yelled at one of my sisters ""Caroline there's Vladek! Hurry and do something!"" But they didn't even care. Finally I got them to squirt him (I guess with a squirt gun). Then I told them to wait while I went and got something so one of them sat down and the other went into our house and upstairs to go do something. So I went off to go and get whatever it was I was trying to get. Then I saw Vladek again and I raced off yelling to my sisters ""Caroline! Maddie! Come here quick!"" So they finally came but when they arrived Vladek said to surrender. So we put our hands up and then the last scene the dream showed was a school bus with me and my sisters in it like a paddy wagon. I'm homeschooled so in the dream this was the worst thing that could happen to me so I was terrified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other race,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No longer denizens of the natural world their flesh rotted on their bone and every few steps you could see a chunk fall off revealing maggots crawling throughout their ghastly bodies. The dehumanization kicked in early I quickly became detached from the faces of those I once was acquainted with my family meant nothing to me anymore if ever. I spent what seemed like forever at the time dismembering the repulsing bodies the dark slop that replaced blood stained my hands I didn't care that was my task I did it with honour. In a field that seemed to glow in the night sky I found myself sometime later staring up at the sky. The dark blue speckled with white stars was replaced with a ominous red glow. . .the stars were gone. . .everything was gone. . .nothing was left for me. . .even so I carried on. I don't know why I had to kill them maybe it was just so I didn't have to think but when I finally found myself alone with my thoughts I found that I enjoyed the act of ending their [insert deity of choice here]-forsworn lives. It brought me pleasure. Days past like this in the dream. Minutes to hours hours to days days to weeks it all melted together that is until he found me. The blackish slop that sludged through the creatures was thick it matted my hair it found comfort in the creases of my arm the bends in my fingers I had grown accustomed to it's stench maybe that's why he thought I was one of them or maybe he knew I was alive. It could have been an act of love freeing me from that hell or an act of spite banishing me from his world either way I could see the whites of his eyes as he stared into mine a broken man the past locked away as not to remind him of the happiness that will never return away. The barrel of the gun steady on my forehead I saw a face I remembered well when I heard the fire that awakened me in another world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Decline to answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So they dropped me off at my old math room and we were out sitting and talking and I still had butterflies in my stomach for how totally awesome this whole situation was and then we all went into the room where my old math teacher was and he was super surprised about who I was with too but then he gave a huge smile and welcomed them to play. The next thing I know these two are playing a match of ping pong against each other and everyone is super excited and then Roger asked me if I would like to play. Suddenly I was all nervous and told everyone that I was not as good at ping pong as I was at tennis.

Something had happened previously in the dream which I don't recall but I was exhausted and sore. I was filling a bath barely awake waiting naked by the tub when a knock came on the door. It opened tentatively and my boyfriend came in. I stumbled and fell into his arms about to say something when he shushed me tenderness filling his eyes. He helped me into the tub since I was so weak I could hardly stand. Then he took off his own clothes to avoid getting them wet. And he proceeded to gently clean me he had no sexual intents whatsoever just pure tender love and care. He did become aroused but apologized for it and tried to ignore it. I gave him a weak kiss of thanks for the help for being so kind and not trying to take advantage of my injured state. And as I kissed him the door to the bathroom opened and my father walked in. He has a short fuse and this lit it of course it looks terrible. He started to attack and yell and pull my boyfriend out but then the dream shifted to a completely different dream that one I don't recall. I was 16 when I had this dream and when I woke up I was drenched in a cold sweat.

There was a huge red sea outside of the window with an orange sunset in the background. A huge boat sat waiting for us as well. It looked like some sort of a pirate boat. I jumped onto the deck of the boat with my toys which now had eye patches and sailor hats. They yelled things back and forth in sailor talk. That's when I saw another boat with evil toys a little bit farther away from us. They started to shoot cannons at our boat. I remember I was scared and kept telling myself to wake up it's just a dream. I went up to Cheer Bear and said ""Help me I can't wake up!"" and she told me ""You can't leave us Brooke!

About 20 other people were standing on the plain as well. We didn't have anything to do so we just wandered around and a few of us chatted now and then. Suddenly we heard a loud sound. We immediately started running toward the sound. No one wanted to be the last one to arrive. We knew that no one who arrived last ever came back. I was frightened but was the middle arrival. We all lined up in the order of arrival first in front last in back. Facing the first person in line was the huge robot from Star Wars. It inspected each one of us as we walked forward holding our breath and thankful we weren't the last in line. I was wondering what was happening to the stranger I saw in the back of the line as we moseyed back to our spot. We were bored for what seemed like hours when the loud sound came again. We ran and I came in last. When everyone else had left The robot turned to me. I had a panicky sinking feeling. It pointed its gun at me and I knew it was going to shoot me. I tried to run but I felt the bullet sink into my back and I fell. I woke up unable to breathe. I was 6 years old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Decline to answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4171,,,,,Male,ID: harris_youth_2011:42611 details,05-03-2011,This dream recurred to me a few times in my early youth. The last time I dreamt it I was four years old and attended a preschool. I'd never been in a helicopter but in this dream my preschool teacher and I hovered above my preschool and all its other children. Soon we landed [as if normal] and I went home. At home a grabbed a couple of maple leaves (the Canada kind although my home is New Jersey) pinched each between pointer and thumb fingers and flapped them like wings. I gained flight and flew to my city's downtown district where amongst the usual tall buildings there was Big Ben in the middle (probably a result of watching 101 Dalmations). I flew past the grand clock and over the Atlantic Ocean evidently on route to some place in Europe. I landed at an [American-looking] amusement park similar to Six Flags where my mother was nearby. The dream fades out and I always awake after reaching that destination. I should add that the recurrent dream has one variation in which after crossing the Atlantic I meet a penniless vagrant who wordlessly motions something to me though I cannot recall what.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is some sort of natural disaster happening outside (usually a tornado) and all of the customers are hiding in the corner behind a barricade of games. I am scared and have to run by a dinosaur game which had frightened me in reality as well. (The game had motion sensors so that it roared whenever a patron would walk by it.) I remember hearing the roar and running to the corner where everyone else was. Then we get into a coveniently placed elevator. The elevator isn't large but all of us don't seem to have any difficulty in standing in it comfortably. (Dream magic!) The elevator starts moving but then jerks in different directions.

He had these half-sphere-like lights on the ground and each had some kind of picture on them. They glowed a soft pinkish yellow color. The mad scientist(my arch enemy)had this mechanical arm and it was a very sharp point on the end no hand. He said which ever one of us can hop on the lights and get to the end first wins the arm. I won but he just laughed and said ""Ha Ha Ha! This is my arm you can't have it!"" and i replied ""But I won!"" he said ""you think I care! I'm not going to give you my arm!!!"" then he de-masked me and took my top half of my costume/disguise off and said i knew who you were! then he stabbed me with his arm 4 times where if you drew lines to connect the holes it would be a large square.

Bass reverberations rattle the walls and soothe a teenager's heart as she weaves through the crowd. She entices many men but none of them are what she's looking for. Now a gloved hand grabs her arm and pulls her in towards the center of the crowd. The touch sends a jolt of electricity up her arm or so it seems. She suddenly knows this is who she's looking for. She is pulled to the center of the mass of people. There is a small clearing in which two teenage boys are standing. They are both clad in all black gloves and body suits. She pauses for a moment as one more dominant pulls her to him. What kind of material was that suit made of? Definitely not spandex surely not cotton. They begin to dance rather tamely. They other boy watches his body language suggesting smugness. That's when the girl realizes they're both wearing very familiar looking helmets. Then how was she seeing their faces?

The dream some how started out with me having the task of proving that this old man, that I was partnered up with, was the coolest guy on Earth. The setting was at a very big, nice, modern mall. The mall was very busy and it had glass doors and alot of sky lights. It was a sunny day outside so in turn it was bright in the mall. The man was a very typical looking 60-65 yr old Caucasian male. His hair was grey and short, he wore glasses, his apparel was modest. White button-down shirt. Once I was given this task which I don't remember how I obtained it, I walked around the mall with him introducing him to people. In particular I remember being in a department store setting when I approached a girl looking to be in her mid-twenties. She was attractive with brown hair and Caucasian. I remember her being particularly impressed with the old man and his style and she commented on his glasses. She was bubbly and had a very picturesque smile. After a short conversation discussing the old man and displaying his coolness I set off to find the next person to show off the old man to. Before continuing my mission I turned around to the old man and asked him his name. He replied 'Seth'. I asked him to spell out his full name. So he than replied 'SETH GREICH' spelling it out. Right when I turned to continue on I woke up. I've never met a 'Seth Greich' so it was completely made up in my head.

None other than my fantasy movie star, Halle Berry, was my seatmate. I tried not to seen too excited about sitting next to her, so I nonchalantly said hello and pretended to read my book, an erotic thriller, and I was excited in more ways than one. The book had me excited, but more so, I was sitting there with Halle. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. But then Halle asked me what I was reading and I felt my cheeks flush, I did not want her to think I was some kind of pervert. I tried to explain about the thriller aspect of the novel but she wanted to read the jacket which was kind of explicit in itself. She started laughing when she read certain parts but then opened the book to the contents and started reading again. I tried to watch her out of my peripherals and it seemed that I could hear her breathing increase. I offered to let her continue reading, as I had another book. She wanted to know if it was as exciting as this one. I was tongue-tied and at first didn't know what to say.

We said our goodbyes and I floated down the rampway to baggage claim. Still in heaven as I awaited my luggage, I was thinking, ""darn, why didn't I get her autograph?"" but now it was too late. My euphoria turned to sadness at the thought. I decided to read to get my mind off of that thought.

By the time you are up at the top of the mountain, you have ran out of trees and among the cliffs. The rocks are a beige in color, and as you curve around a bend, you find a cave opening. If you continue around the bend, there is another way up to the top of the mountain, but this is more steep and treacherous. The difference is the lack of trees on that route. Once inside the cave, you find that there are multiple crevices which peer outside to the path that you came on. The cave meanders around deeper into the ground, and as you follow the path, it gets increasingly dark. There is a door of some sort, which leads to a deeper, wetter, darker cavern. As you are explore this area, you have the feeling that you are being watched, and that there is something else in the cave with you. You decide that you are done exploring, based on this, and proceed to leave. You take the path back down the canyon, but as darkness approaches, you camp at the campground halfway down. As you are there, you see plenty of others also there, but you still have the feeling that what was in the cavern, has followed you here. You hear some commotion from some of the other camps and decide to take off. You start running down the path in the dark, as you feel something following. About this time you wake up.

I remember driving down the streets of Frankfort KY on the way to the lottery office, but in real life I have no idea how to find the actual office. I have never been to the Dave Ramsey offices, but in my dream it was a large red brick building with a lot of windows.

My sister and I were on our land, at our grandmothers house (which burned down many years ago) but the surroundings were different; there was a major highwaypass in the distance, over the treetops- it should have been in the middle of the country with only gravel roads. It was early afternoon with a pale blue sky and muted green grass. There was something with a window and weedeater too, but its blurry. Our dog and mother appeared to tell us that there were going to be people breaking into the house but it would be okay, just be ready. I asked her all kinds of questions and assured her (myself) I would be okay. My sister and I then walked all over the house, inside and out and in again. Once we cleared it, they got ready to leave. As my sister and I were saying our goodbyes, she told me to hush, she heard a noise. The carpet was such an electric blue it was blinding. Then we heard the toilet flush. They had broken in. We had to defend. We stayed put, in the dark, and waited to see what they wanted. I remember being very angry they wanted something of my grandmas. When I saw a shadow in the hall, we trapped him in the bathroom with blue tiles. We waited for his partner. Shortly after the partner arrived through the same window his partner used in the other bathroom before coming down the hallway. I followed him to the laundry room before I kicked him. I managed to overpower him and ask what he wanted, who he was, why he was here and who he worked for. He answered that he acquired goods for people and he was employed by the government and he wanted our washer, dryer and freezer (the washer and dryer images in my dream were very different from the originals at grandmas; and the house fire was caused by the dryer). He said we could work out a deal. He even offered me a job! I told him off. Then I went on a rant about the highway overpass encroaching on my land and how humans are destroying earth. I woke myself up talking; I assume it was something about human environmental negligence.

In the dream I remember playing through a game with well known players of the era, Luis Aparicio, Jim Busby, Sherm Lollar, and many others. Even though I had not attended a White Sox game, I often listened to them with my grandfather and with other members of the family, so I remember seeing the faces of the players, some of their hits, and some of the great fielding plays that they made. I was excited by the broadcasts and those feeling and thoughts carried over into my playing habits during the day and into the dreams I had about the team winning the American League pennant and playing in the World Series. I remember distinctly seeing the players in my dreams in their uniforms as well as visualizing the members of my family who were also listening to the games and then eventually watching them on the first TV we had in 1955.

I don't know how I knew it but I did. In the dream I was awakened by a creaking floor board. I promptly retrieved my gun from its safe and woke my wife to tell her to call 911. I got the kids and my wife all into a safe room and locked the door when I left the room to go and confront the intruder(s). I slowly and methodically made my way through all the rooms in the upstairs making sure that they were clear then made my way down the stairs. When I made my way into my den I found one dark clothed individual wearing a black ski mask going through my desk. I pointed the weapon in his direction and instructed him to lay on the floor. At that moment I noticed his eyes move to the left side were there was a side door to the den. I moved my body and weapon towards the door and there was another individual dressed the same as the first rapidly coming towards me. I fired two quick rounds and the individual dropped to the floor. Realizing that the first threat had been nuetralized I returned my gaze to the first individual and noticed that he was reaching for something in his pockets that I could only assume given the situation was a weapon. I yelled for him to once again get on the floor but instead he started to charge at me. Two more quick shots and he was on the ground also. Realizing that these two were no longer threats I finished clearing the rest of the house right as the police arrived. Then I awoke from the dream, my heart racing and breathing heavily as if it had really happened. This dream happened to me just after returning from Afganistan back in 2005.

To the left were beautiful brownish grey tan mountains extending up to the high clouds. All to my right and behind me was a huge field of some type of white and yellow wildflowers. The entire area was like a horseshoe overlooking the ocean, with me standing at the bottom of the U. The ocean below is a stunning shade of Blue. Although it was a long way down the cliff to the ocean, I can clearly hear the sounds of the surf below. Its late spring, maybe early summer and the sun is setting over the ocean (or is it a sunrise?). The shades of red and orange stretch on as far as the eye can see. The scene is timeless, and I'm not sure if the sun is setting or rising as I try to analyses the scene. Then I realize, it doesn?t matter. Now instead of standing, I am sitting near the edge of the cliff, leaning against a tall oak tree with high branches that extend over the cliff. Somehow I can tell that this tree is ancient, possibly hundreds of years old. Wise somehow but untouched by man or time. I sit here in the peace for what seems like hours but yet only minutes at the same time. I notice some sort of ship on the horizon as a gentle breeze begins to blow. The ground is comfortable, almost soft. I am warm and at peace. I get the sense that someone is in the field, close to me over my left shoulder. I'm not scared, but curious as to who it could be.

4373,,,,,,,04-02-2011,"I had a dream about my deceased father. One night while watching the evening news, there was a story about a golfing community in Arizona. In the background, a man was seen taking a shot of the tee. I immediately froze because the man looked a lot like my father. The hair was a little thinner and sparse, plus he was wearing a beard but he sure looked like my father. I have a DVR attached to my TV so I rewound the program a few different times and and was convinced it was him. I tried tracking him down through the local news channel which filmed the story in Arizona but they didn't know who the man was because he was never interviewed. I contacted the golf course and the only information they had was for the member(not the man I believed was my father) who reserved the grouping at that time. They would not give me his information. I decided to fly out to Arizona because I was still convinced the man I saw on the news station was my father. The golf course was located near Phoenix so I flew there, rented a car and began my search. I went to the golf course and tried talking with the manager in person explaining my situation but due to privacy concerns, he would not give me the member's information. Resigned to idea of having to find a new way to track them down, I was about to leave and find my hotel. As I was leaving, I noticed one of the grounds keepers passing nearby. I flagged down the man and showed him the picture I had printed off from a screen grab of the news program. At this point my memories of the dream start getting fuzzy. I do not remember what the grounds keeper said but either he or someone must have given me the information I was looking for because I do remember walking up to a very nice house and knocking on the door. I met the man who had made the tee time reservation at the golf course and introduced myself. Without even saying why I was there, he said I must be a nephew of a man named Steve cause I looked a lot like him. After being invited in and sitting down to a beer, I showed him the picture I had and asked if that was Steve. With a confused look, Mr. Thompson said yes. I then dug out an older picture of my father and said, ""Mr. Thompson, the man you know as Steve, is the man I know as Jerry, my father."" He sat there in stunned silence as I explained how my father died 8 years before and how I didn't see how any of this was possible because I had seen him laying dead in the hospital and at the funeral home. Mr. Thompson explained how he had hired ""Steve"" as the lead of one of his maintenance crews for various projects in the Phoenix area. ""Steve"" had helped cut costs for his crew, weed out some bad employees and was promoted to the director of maintenance. That was how he had become one of Mr. Thompson's golfing buddies. We talked for a while more and Mr. Thompson drove me over to ""Steve's"" house. There was a ton of nervousness as I walked from the driveway up to the front door. I rang the doorbell and stared at the peep hole, nearly frozen where I stood. The door opened and there stood the man people in Arizona knew as ""Steve."" He was the man I knew as my father. I woke up from my dream sweating and breathing really hard. I never got back to sleep that night. That was at least the 5th dream I had about my father still being alive living somewhere else.

4388,,,,,Female,ID: harris_2011:024656 details,04-02-2011,"This is a true story: When I was younger, approximately 11 yrs old, I started having a reocurring dream of falling off a very tall building/mountain. Each time before I hit the ground I would awake. This dream didn't occur each and every night, but it did happen often as I grew up. The first car I ever bought was a 1969 Ford Mustang, Hawaiin (sp.?) Blue, Fastback, it had everything on it that you could imagine at that particular time, it was beautiful. One day after I started working my new job I was coming home from work on the interstate (back then the speed limit in the city limits was 70 mph.) I was driving up over a rise in the road and heard cars ahead of me crashing, as I crested the small hill, there was a car in front of me sliding sideways, had I not put both feet on the brake I would have slammed into the driver's side at 70 mph. As it turned out, when I hit the brake witnesses said that my left front wheel/tire hit the curb, then my right front, then my left rear, then my right rear in that order. Once that happened I was airborn and landed on an entrance to the interstate. There was a car repair shop a little bit away from the accident and he said because of the way my tires hit the curb is the only reason I didn't flip over. Therefore, I landed on all four tires, I received a back injury from the accident, but not too severe, and my A-Frame on the brand new (six months old) Mustang was bent. It took another 8 months before I had my car back and I never received a ticket from the accident because the Highway Patrol Office said it was ""An Act of God"" because I avoided hitting another car in front of me. But because I went airborn in my car, I never had that dream again of falling from a high place. I have talked about this accident from time to time in my life and even though I think about it, it does not spark another dream of the same nature.

help me!"" and he just kept coming forward, and thats when i noticed he too had been turned into a zombie! i scolded him, ""aw, baby, what did you do? ugh, now i have to cure you."" and as he got closer, still holding out the flower for me to take, i scratched the bare skin on his wrist to cure him, and he dropped the flower, and went straight to work attacking the zombies. i believe more happened after that, including trying to find the young boy again, but i can't remember it all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not sure,"$150,000 to $199,999",,African American,"Single, never married",West,"Completed graduate school (e.g., M.S., M.D., Ph.D.)",,"No, not of Hispanic origin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe there were a variety of scenerios, but one in particular stuck with me, even now - forty years later. I was leaving a white farm house, which sat at the top of a great sloping hill with a long drive way which meandered through the front acreage. There was a wood fence or gate which the driveway passed through, which separated the yard area of the house and a front pasture area with a small stream flowing across the foot of the slope. I was pulling through the wooden gate (in a white car, of course) and touched the brakes to slow a little before starting down the hill....but there was nothing there (in the brake pedal). The dream ended there, with me sitting on top of that hill with no brakes. In other versions of this dream, I spend a bit of time pressing desparately on the brakes trying to get the car to stop before I wake up - to no avail. Only that one dream took place on the top of the hill, however. The odd thing was, when I was in my mid-twenties, my husband bought a white car which always seemed to have 'iffy' brakes.

In this mirror I saw a very well lit scene of my bedroom as a child. Suddenly I said out loud, ?this room is not here!? At this point I woke up to what I will say is THIS reality. I looked at the clock. 2:43. I was relaxed, at peace and very calm and rested. This dream occurred somewhere in the late ?70s. I would be just into my thirties. I don?t recall color and I very seldom remember dreams so this must be an important one. My feelings about this dream have changed over the years but I may have in fact fought my impending death and the first wake up was to a portal to my childhood, hence seeing the room where a mirror should be, seeing perhaps a source of a problem which made me sweat, become exhausted and upset.

It was bright down there, with golds and greens from feilds. I looked around and the rock walls were covered with niches that were filled with Books. Then I woke up, and never had the dream again.

One night I dreamt I was at a cliff with friends which we had jumped frm many times. It was a hot, humid day and the river was refreshingly cool. To make the jump you had to launch yourself far enough out from the cliff to clear some bushes, small trees and a protruding outcropping. It wasn't particulary difficult to do; you just had to pay attention to what you were doing! In my dream I found myself on top of the cliff. I didn't know why I was there but I was and the night was pitch black. You know, it was so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. I didn't know how I got to where I was but for some reason I knew where I was. I was scared! I had been to this same location hundreds of times and while I knew I was on top of this particular cliff I was not sure where exactly I was in relation to the edge. It was just too damn dark! I knew I needed to get away from the edge of the cliff. I knew by the shape of the cliff which we dove from I only had one direction to step. You see, the point stuck out enough from the cliff that a step to the front or either side I would be stepping into air! Since the point was very narrow I had to be sure of the direction I moved; the slightest movement in the wrong direction I was going down! I stood there for the longest time trying to determine what I was going to do. I decided to bend down and use my hands to feel the ground. As I bent down I never felt the ground as I hwas in space, falling, falling! I knew I had to prepare myself to hit the water -- I continued to fall, fall, fall and then I was awake! My shirt was wet with sweat but I was alright. I was trembling, I was wet but I was OK. This dream started when I was in my twenties and now I am in my 50's and it still occurs but not as frequently. I am always falling backwards and in one version of the dream I am in a car backing towards a cliff and the car goes over the cliff. Now that I have finished telling you about this dream I am edgy, nervous, and worried that it will occur tonight. Will I sleep tonight?

Boy-Howdy that hurt like the devil like I was in his grasp but he had a glove of thorns on, I was able to contain my pain by sitting absolutely still and as tired as I was it became harder to do. I wondered if I could call someone but before I got my month moved just a fraction The pain was back but located in the noggin right in front of each ear. I thought to myself I am definatly not able to move any part of me without explosive pain. The room was not brightly lit and looked as if the walls painted red I noticed that the direction I was looking I could only see out of a little window about 10"" x 5"" Man, whaere in the hell am I, actually hell came to mind very quick I could not hear anything cause my head felt like it was full of water. I was feeling so tired and weak and was sure I would not be able to sit up this way for very much longer. Then I saw a movement or something cahnged the light coming in my little window there was a differet shape and it was moving, oh this doesn't look good but my mind flashed to maybe its someone to help? with that thought..."" would they beable to notice me in this whatever it is could I do something to attrack him/her or?"" so I decided I'd bite the bullet and se if I could get the thing I am in to move. This time the pain made me see orange with a searing pain and a sickness in my stomch to the point it immediately made me vomit, then I was in a fix I could not spit it out and only half of it flowed out I leaned as hard as I could to the right and then I felt this warm liquid running down my back and thought I was going to be sick again instead I realized that all of the effort, with pain as the main attraction was for naught cause the thing didn't even budge an inch, and the shape seemed to ignore me. Okay maybe sound is what its going to have to be. I collected all of the will that I had and borrowed some from Jesus and tried to shout. I don't know if you have ever being in a jungle but you understand when I say its a popourri of sounds and noises and after ya take all the animals sounds so from animals you knew whats left would describe what came out of me and the shape stopped what it was doing and came over close to my little window and said ""I got ya and your mine now... you must admit and then you can come out... I didn't have a clue what he was talking about and as the shodowy shape leaned back aways I strted to pray again to pray as loud as I could. what came out was mostly a whisper but it was prayer the same, ""Jesus lord Jesus, Father God I ask you please help me I have be a good and loyal servent and I think its time to go home now..."" the shadow mved quickly over to my little window and Loudly a string of words, epithets, cussing whatever came out of him. He was walking around shaking his fists at me and cussing up a storm, as I watched him I realized that my little window had cross bars across it and up and down. Leaving only small squares to see out of But I was getting a bit more tollerent of the pain I really tried to focus. I couldn't make out much on the other side of my window there were some long metal objects hanging on the wall, along with swords and whips etc... there was a large wide hallway and a long corridor with a glowing red at the end There was a huge Archway over the hallway entrance and had a bunch of carving or something all I could make out was a goats head st the bottom of one coloum and it lead up and around to another large unidentfed statue and the arch went over and dwn with a very large hallway entrance. The shape continued his ranting and then a mas of shapes apeared being led down the hallway . I was growing weaker by the second and knew I was going to die... I assesed the object I was in again and with the shape of it the little window with crossbars and pain everywhere my mind went to midevil torture cmabers like the Iron Madien. Wow was he in one of those and with a little thought I decide I wouldn't want to rush judgement but I bet I am. Well I don't know how this came to be... actually I could not remember anything nothing about me; who I was, where I was from; nothing. The shadowy shape stopped right in front of me and ceased his ranting and just stared at all of the shapes going down the hallway a shape came over and stood next to him and said loudly to try and talk above the wailing and screaming saying well we got a good haul from Vegas you what me to roll this one down the hallway"".? the other shape just abouit as mad as hell said no! hes going to go the other way the'll be here and second to get him and I may put up a fight. The other shpae stated"" hell.. Mr D its only one out of all of these others..."". 'You don't you get it it is not about numbers its the principal of the thing' he screamed... 'He wins this one like so many others that follow him. I was pondering that for a minute trying to make sense of it but the pain all over and the dizzeness and fatique was really starting to take its toll... and My wife woke me up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Less than $10,000","Less than $15,000",,White,Married,West,"Completed some college, but no degree",,"No, not of Hispanic origin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trail was so close that it was worthwhile to make the short sidetrip to the peak. I got to the top, looked around and thought ""Well, isn't this nice!"" and went back down to the ""trail"" The pass was hugely dangerous with the path sometimes a mere board bolted to the side of a cliff with thousands of feet of air below it. It was terrifying and exhiliarating. Unfortunately I don't remember much more except that I made the return trip to the starting point and repeated the journey guiding someone else. It ended at a town, the journey that is. I can't help but feel there was some kind of spiritual element in the dream as when I woke up I was feeling uncommonly well and I could actually remember this dream in detail, at least for awhile.

I just remember watching everyone leave. I was feeling nervous about getting caught and where to go.

One was a little marshmallow type trailer, the kind families tow behind little cars, and the other was the trailer from an 18-wheeler. There no windows or windshields and was puzzled as to how he was going to drive. Suddenly, we ended up at a very rocky cliff side, kind of like the edge of a waste dump. There was a waterfall that shot over the edge. Over time I guess the pressure of the waterfall had churned up the dirty brown water below and created a foam that sat on top. As we moved closer to the waterfall I kept getting hit with foam. I think we were trying to get behind the waterfall to hide. I kept getting water in my bag and then suddenly noticed that policemen were climbing next to me. We spoke briefly but I don't remember what was said.

It was really fun and I was excited and happy. But then the water started getting really choppy and our canoe kept tipping over because my dad was steering it really crazy and trying to go too fast. I asked him to please go slower because there were sharp, red rocks under the water, but he just got angry and rolled his eyes and wouldn't listen. When we all fell off the next time, there ws a huge wave that suddenly built up and crashed down on us. My mom said it was monsoon winds, which made me think to myself we must not be in a lake, but in the ocean by Asia. The wave swept me under, but luckily I grabbed onto a rock and climbed onto it and my sister helped me swim back to the group. We abandoned the canoe and got onto two house boats. when I climbed onto our boat, I told my dad he almost killed me because of his driving. He got pissed because I was criticizing him. When we docked up, my aunts and uncle had to leave. We carried all their stuff to their cars, including a casserole that my sister had to help me with because it was too heavy- she said it weighed 6 pounds because of the peanut butter in it. My dad tried to get my aunt to take home her leftovers (broccoli, rice, pasta with white sauce) after he mixed them altogether and added way too much salt. She was nice and told us to keep them. I was annoyed my dad added so much salt. On my stone driveway, I talked to a girl from the canoe. Apparently, she, Jeff and I were going to a dance at my school the next night. I told her, I'm so sorry if it sucks because my school doesn't have good dances and they're kind of lame. Her mom was going to come with us back to the boat. Her son was really cute, and I noticed my sister flirting with him. I could tell she liked him and there was something going on between them. He was short, almost shorter than one of my aunts. Back on the boat, me and my sister were making fun of my mom because we could hear her singing in the shower, when the woman from the canoe interrupted us and told us to pick a sticker. Mine was different from the others and the woman told me it meant I was the one sleeping with her husband. She was crazy and I was so frustrated because I couldn't convince her it wasn't true. We argued until I walked away, into a room where my boyfriend Jeff and some friends of his I met at a wedding were playing ping pong. I heard one of his friends ask, ""ready for another shot?"" Jeff said, ""no, I'm good."" I walked off because Jeff had promised me he wouldn't drink, or I'd leave him. He found me crying in a bedroom, but didn't seem to care. I told him I've given him too many chances and I was leaving him.

There were big sand dunes everywhere. The sand was tan colored and the grains of sand were big, like in Hawaii (oahu). Me & Carlyn were planning on going surfing; our boards were huge & hard to carry over the big sand dunes. We finally reached the water. The beach looked like sunset beach in Oahu. The waves were perfect, double overhead and glassy. I said that to Carlyn in my dream. It was easy to paddle out & take off on waves. I could feel the water & the friction of the wave & board under my feet. After I caught my wave I paddled back out, but I couldn’t find Carlyn. I looked around frantically and finally spotted her on shore. She was yelling something to me, but I couldn’t hear what she was saying. I tried to yell back to her but no sound came out of my mouth. I was trying to yell back to her and was frustrated and scared because I couldn’t. Then, a huge wave—over 100 feet—pounded on top of me and sent me flying back to the beach. I wasn’t hurt. On the beach, my Aunt Liz was sitting under the umbrella. She had to keep moving her stuff back up the dunes because the ride was coming up. The tide wasn’t normal though. The waves were crashing right on top of people and they just kept crashing. I wanted to get back in the water, but no one would let me. I saw the big waves and 3 enormous shark fins, but I didn’t understand why they wouldn’t let me. I tried to yell at my aunt Liz for not letting me go back in. I wanted to tell her that I could handle myself & I knew what I was doing, but she wouldn’t hear me. Again, no sound was coming out of my mouth and she was trying to make sure her beach stuff didn’t get wet. I walked away & ended up on a cliff. I was looking over the cliff at the water, which was dark and frothy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He fell into the ocean and on one seemed to care that he can’t swim. My older sister said she would jump in, but her hair would get wet, my younger sister said the water is way to cold to go for a swim and my mom was like “oh god now we have to call for help” in a very careless tone.

It was filming a guy on the porch of his house, (the guy was doing something I don’t recall), and I realized that I recognized the house he was at, and that his house was across the street. So we all went outside and watched some random guy making a fool of himself, which is apparently what In Living Color became. After this dream became surprisingly, weirder and less understandable. My friends and I decided that we needed drugs, so we decided to go get some. We ended up at my elementary school, which is although it was still on elementary school, it was a bar and arcade inside with lots of people and lights. I had to go use the restroom, so I did, and I met a guy who wanted to sell me drugs. I went back out to my friends and we gave the guy a couple hundred dollars. His friend, (who had somehow shown up), pulled a gun out and the other guy reached into his back pocket. I thought “damn, cops”, but it turned out that he just had water balloons, which he started throwing at us while yelling at us to get lost. At this point a cop did show up, and he pulled his gun on the other guys. Something happened, but I didn’t think I even dreamed about it, it’s not that I can’t remember. Regardless, my friends and I were now walking down the street outside of my elementary school with beer, drugs, and all of our money back. At this point, my younger brother was now with us, and he was telling us that the house on the corner that we were approaching had a crazy old lady who lived in it and she leeched internet and tech support from SCU, (which was now at the same location as my elementary school and the arcade place, but this didn’t create a problem for my dream). We went onto this lady’s well-lit front porch, which I thought was a bad idea because those drug dealers from before might see us. Sure enough, they did show up, and we all started arguing. Then I looked down the street and saw an enormous sun rising. Except that this “sun” wasn’t rising, it was just a big ball of fire and it streaked across the sky. Then it turned out to be a spaceship the size of a city, and it crashed down the street. Myself, my friends, and the drug dealers (who we were now on very good terms with), went down to check it out. It was surrounded by a chain link fence and had government agents everywhere already, which I remember thinking was rather surprising and unnaturally fast. We still went inside and started watching a display on the side of the ship with some of the government guys. It turned out to be a video game of some sort with different colored characters, and we all started betting on them and cheering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My friend Alison from high school (who I’m not really friends with anymore) was there and we started talking about the dream assignment. She said she had already finished hers for both nights. I began to think I hadn’t had enough meaningful dreams to actually write about them, and that maybe I should wait and write about my dreams another morning. Then I went and did my dream analysis. Then I was all of a sudden in a different place, but still with the feeling that the field/ pay arena was nearby. This play arena had a big blow up play thing, but it wasn’t just for play – people had a purpose for being there. I was in this other place watching over a balcony – looking at a big canyon. There were two guys climbing one of the canyon walls. They had weird blue stilt- like things on their feet. They were bouncing up the incline really fast. This activity had something to do with the play arena activities. Then someone said people had died doing what the two boys were doing.

Then they went back to rock climbing, but it wasn’t Justin anymore, it was different people and they looked like they were going to fall because they weren’t attached by ropes and then I became overcome by fear. Also (not sure where) I ran into my roommate’s mother and sister. There was a party going on, and I guess we were at a USC- sponsored party, because my roommate’s mom told her sister that she should try to get more beer from the keg because she was a USC cheerleader.

As we were driving I remember looking out the window at all the nice houses in the area and wishing I could live in a house like that. As we were driving we came to what was supposed to be UCLA. I told my mom that she wouldn’t be able to convince me to change schools. This UCLS, however, was like a waterpark. It was early morning and there were little kids running around with a lot of Disney costume people. I remember asking myself where all the students, but remembering it was early and most students sleep in. The final thing in my dream was a girl from my high school, Christina Murrillo, walking by with her friends. I said hi to her and thought that her friends were very pretty.

The room was an old wooden cabin. I think I was laying on a cot in the room and someone else was reading the newspaper. [ANOTHER DREAM] took place in the house I lived in when I was 2-5 years old. Someone else lived there now and had re-designed the backyard. They took out the cement steps and made a grassy hill. I was there with my family and cousins. We were all getting dressed up to go somewhere and my cousins—two girls-were looking at photos of my friends from home, telling me which one I should bring to the party with us. [ANOTHER DREAM] I was in a car full of girls and we were on our way to a party in San Francisco-I think. There had been an issue over who was going to what party-we all wanted to have a party together or go to the same one, but it turned out we were going to three different ones. In the car, someone asked if we could stop and buy lotion and the person driving the car said that every store had run out of lotion. We laughed, thinking that was absurd-but luckily we had our own bottle of lotion with us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn't remember what had happened the night before or how I ended up on a sandy ground alone, so I was confused and lost. I walked around trying to find something familiar and found a fort-like circle of benches and wood panels tucked under some sand. When I started to walk down to it for shelter/rest, the two older men walked up and I felt relieved. They led me out of the sand field and brought me to a swim meet I apparently had scheduled. [I don’t remember how we were transported to it.] All of a sudden I was in my swim suit and the race started. I was an awful swimmer and finished far behind my opponents. I was very nervous the whole time and exhausted when I finished. After I finished, I took off my goggles and felt some bumps in my mouth. I realized I had two silver tongue piercings, only on the sides of my tongue instead of in the middle. I got out of the pool and asked the two men what had happened the night before and how I got these ugly piercings. They told me we had all gotten extremely intoxicated and when I blacked out they talked me into going to the piercing salon. The piercings started to throb so they took me to the doctor, who gave me a lecture about not taking care of my piercings. He told me they were infected, applied some gel, and sent me home. I was upset with the older men for letting this happen while I was so drunk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4539,,,,,Female,ID: kahan_sleep_wake_3664 details,02-05-2011,"I was in a big pool. It was country and there was no other country on the other side of a divider. Both of these pools were in a store, such as you would find in a mall, but this was an outdoor mall. The country that I was in was in the back of the store. It was relatively dark, but artificially lit with bluish pool-esque lighting. There was a wall that didn’t quite go to the ceiling that divided the front and back countries. The front country was lit with warm orange/red/yellow afternoon light which pored in through the store windows. I was with someone else and we were content in the back country splashing around. I think there was a big white block pedestal in the middle to sit on. Somehow we decided to go to the front country via a water path on the right of wall. There were obstacles (blacks/buoys) floating in the middle. There were also waves, but only in the path, WE managed to get across and splash around in the front country. People walked by the store front windows, paying no attention to what was inside there were other people in the front country. WE ended up going back to the back country but something/ someone was there and casing us. I lost track of my companion and tried to escape through the side path. The water was shallow enough to still keep my floating, but as hard as I ran I want getting any farther. I thought this was odd, until I finally made it to the other side. Everything was happy here. After a moment everyone noticed something in the display windows of a big department store-ish place. I remembered that Chevy’s (the brand of the futuristic card in the window) were cool cars. Everyone agreed as we “ooed” and “ahhed”. I said this, not recognizing the car model only the maker, in an attempt to sound like I knew what I was talking about and sound cool. We moved closer (possibly went outside) to see better. Part of the car turn out to be boxes or something next to it in the display. They were small and brightly colored. I think I was the one on who thought that they were part of the car, but I didn’t say anything. Everyone went in the store as I looked a the display.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4540,,,,,Female,ID: kahan_sleep_wake_3664 details,02-05-2011,"At the end there was like a movie preview that I wasn’t exactly watching but I wasn’t apart of either It was starring Ben Stiller who somehow had come across an old woman who was a midget and a widow. It was Christmas time and there lots of people around but it wasn’t crowded or loud. The woman romantically interested in Stiller, but he had no idea. During the clip from the Christmas party scene where the woman repeated something funny someone had said in my dream I noticed this and was slightly confused. While saying this the old woman was sitting at a tall round table in the corner of a room that next to the opening to a living room where there was a fireplace with a fire in it. Ben Stiller was sitting on the other side of this table. They were both kind of leaning in and half sitting hal standing there were like classy versions of bar furniture. The woman, with her witty comment, was giving some sort of toast, I think I remember it being Christmas after her husband died. There was a relatively small crowd of people listening. The camera zoomed in through the crowd to the woman talking. There was a clip of Ben Stiller walking arm in arm with a beautiful woman. They were all bundled up in a long woolen coats and scarves. It was night and they were walking down a snowy sidewalk. One of the old woman’s friends (a main character) was lying on his back looking up towards the camera and said something to the old woman about “if you treat like a teacher…” Basically he wont love you like that. In the dream I knew the movie as if I had seen the trailer already. I wasn’t exactly watching the trailer on a screen, but I wasn’t part of it. It was like a break in the middle of my dream and the seemed normal to me. I could hear the announcer. Before this, in my dream, I was at a house possibly my fathers after my parents had gotten a divorce and things were settled. I was talking to my aunt and my dad about some big event that we were going to watch liver later, may have been dinner (which we would’ve participated in). I walked into the bathroom, going to do something to my hair (die it/cut it?) I was surprised to find 2 or 3 other girls there hanging out, in towels, aw if they were always there, getting out of the shower. I remember, in my dream, that I had been one of them before (earlier in my dream) I was embarrassed about what I was doing in the bathroom and started to leave but for some reason turned around and stayed and started doing my hair. This was all during a party of sorts. During the day, very laid back, no one concentration of people, but people wandering scattered about. 2 of my professor, (whose practicum I’ve been in since last winter and who are very laid back) walk in, to tell us the event will start soon (dinner). The girls are nonchalantly talking about roofies and my professor says something about the first one ever made not having a cure, but no one uses it because it smells rancid. I think the girls had one and dropped it in a cup which made it kind of smoke. The whole time I was in the bathroom, I felt a little awkward and out of place and dirty in a immoral impure thoughts kind of way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Later, same building. We took the elevator to the lowest level-I think we were supposed to be giving a tour of the school. [THEN] Some sort of party on the beach. I was standing by my car- putting sunscreen on. A family friend named Sally C. came up and said hi with her daughter-we caught up for awhile. It was really fun to talk with her. Later all my friends started showing up with their parents, sitting at tables on the water. My brother, my dad and I were all dressed pretty preppy and the table of guys next to us wanted to guess where we were from. Finally we told him Idaho, but he got it confused with Iowa. A group of girls had to move tables toward the light- next to our table-when it got dark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not sure where, and we were all walking downtown and I saw this girl who I actually only met a few weeks ago, but she was walking towards me and at first I was excited to see her, then I realized somehow that she was a boy, like she had facial hair. I just remember being so confused because when I met her I thought she was cute (I'm gay) but in my dream she was like male and it confused me so much. I wanted to go ask her what happened and I was trying to follow her but she went into a building and I tried to go follow her but my sister was telling me how we had to leave for our trip. Somehow, we got to this house on a hill with a big balcony and everyone was running around and moving things around. I didn't know that I was supposed to be doing or even why they all were in such a hurry. I felt really bad because they were acting like I was in there way, but I didn't know what was going on. then my mom was like, OK well, it's time to. And I was following them all down this path and there was a house and she was like we can't go in yet, we'll have to sleep outside and I was really annoyed because my brother tried to take the nice soft looking spot and I wanted to sleep there.

4543,,,,,Female,ID: kahan_sleep_wake_909 details,02-05-2011,"My dream felt so crazy and unusual. As far as I can recollect my memories, I was at a pet store and bought myself a bucketful of these baby anacondas. I remember the cold and slimey feeling when I was holding them. I brought them home and left them in my room. There was a fish tank with some baby turtles there and thought to myself how did they survived when I never fed them. That’s where I realized that the automatic feeder was on. At some point, I was really disgusted with the snakes so I left some water in the bucket, covered the lid with something and left it outside the front door. Later on, I guess I went to sleep and woke up the next morning. I was trying to get ready for school and rushed myself into the kitchen only to find myself I was taking a nude shower with my Aunt Quynh Hoa was around using the kitchen. After I was almost ready to leave and about to find my brother and father to ride to school, my brother came home FROM school. He pointed out what time it was and it was already noon.

4544,,,,,Female,ID: kahan_sleep_wake_5454 details,02-05-2011,In my dream I woke up in the morning and walked out to my living room. At this point in the dream I thought I was awake and that everything that was happening was real. I walked out to my living room and noticed the living room to the outside was open. I thought to myself “I hope no one came inside while I was asleep”. I looked at my DVD stands and noticed that almost all of my DVDs had been stolen. I text messaged my best friend to tell him my DVDs had been stolen. I stood there staring at the empty space on the DVD stands trying to figure out which of the DVDs I wanted to replace. I didn’t have the money to replace them all. I was also thinking about how there had been someone inside my house while I was asleep. I thought about if it was a guy he could have found me and possibly raped me. None of that mattered to me anymore when minutes later lightning started to light up the sky. I guess a town evacuation had been put in place because the whole of Palo Alto was going to go up in flames because of the lightning. My dad and I made it on the only plane out of town. We were glad about that and there were a few people we knew on the plane. The only problem was that the plane was on the verge of exploding because of a bad fuel tank. But that was the only plane we could take. The plane had to fly really low to the ground to keep from exploding. I thought that maybe we should try to even the weight out on the plane and that might help but the pilot didn’t seem to like the idea. But he ended up asking a woman whom he called “big” to move to the other side of the plane. I was totally shocked that he had the nerve to call her that. The pilot needed help with something (I think directions fro where we were going) and he called to the back of the plane for a woman named Diana to help him but she was pretending to be asleep so she didn’t go help him. We were getting reports in of thousands of deaths across the country from flooding. I took off my sunglasses and realized that I was wearing my glasses underneath and I got really self-conscious because I hate wearing my glasses in public. I was wondering if I would have had time to put my contacts in before we got on the plane. We got to out destination safely. It was somewhere on the east coast. It was a little bit flooded where we were but it wasn’t too bad. We heard the final death toll from the cross-country storm and it had actually been only one or two people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4545,,,,,Female,ID: kahan_sleep_wake_314 details,02-05-2011,"I was going to the 10PM Student Mass w/my friend Meggan. It was quite dark outside. We walked over to the church around 9:45PM. When we got inside, there must have only been 10 ppl scattered throughout. I walked in, & sitting near the alter was my friend Chris. I was so excited to see him—he’s abroad this whole year at Oxford. I gave him a huge hug. I didn’t know that he was back @ SCU, but he explained that he was back for about a week, then he’d fly back to Oxford for the last 2 or 3 weeks of the Spring term & then fly back. I was envisioning this calendar in my head & remember thinking how crazy & frivolous it seemed to make trips like this so close together. I figured he must be homesick. He showed me the book he was reading—something about grace—the print on the cover was in Green cursive & the cover was tan/beige. He said he loves reading w/Jesus in the Church because it makes the reading less overwhelming. I sat down next to Chris, waiting for Mass to start & Meggan sat next to me. Soon his girlfriend showed up & sat a couple seats away from Chris since the seats next to him were already taken. I was so happy to get to sit next to him & remember wondering why I hadn’t found him attractive last year—he was so good looking now. I was frustrated that I hadn’t jumped on this opportunity while I had the chance. I had forgotten my sweater & the church was a little cold, so I left to go back to my room & get it. I was wearing my Boy Scout shirt & needed my black sweater before Mass started. On my way back to the Church, I saw Meggan’s roommate, Stephanie, walking towards the Church. I was surprised b/c Steph is an atheist & has never come to Mass before. I was glad at first, until she explained that she brought “materials to work on” since she was sure to get bored w/all of the “religious magic.” I took a deep breath & tried to explain that it would be really disrespectful & distracting to others if she did this & that she should just absorb everything—but she was rather flippant about my concern. I felt v. irritated. When we got back into church, it was packed. I looked where Chris was sitting & found that his girlfriend had taken my seat. I felt a twinge of jealousy, but figured she had taken it b/c she probably thought I had really left & wasn’t going to reclaim it. So Meggan, Steph, I, & my friend Dianna, ended up sitting in the very back now. I remember thinking how I’d never sat back there before, but since I had the aisle seat, it wasn’t as bad as I though. A few minutes into Mass, Steph brought out her materials to work on & I felt v. frustrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a patch of snow that I try to step over but end up putting my shoe in it. I am all of a sudden very high up the mountain—I notice after looking at the view, which is beautiful. There are many pine trees but also a great amount of brown rock and snow that make up the mountain. I am a little nervous hiking up the mountain. I hold on to the rock as I walk close to the side. Now I find skis. My family is with me. (We weren’t on the high part of the mountain, but at a ski resort—outside in the snow). We pull out a camera (my small canon camera) and take a picture. I (now back on the mountain) hold the camera out, looking through the LCD screen and take a picture of a pine tree covered with snow, thinking it will make a nice photo card. I’m at the top of a cliff—everything looks soft and cold. I am at a parking lot overlooking a beach. Someone is with me but I am not sure who until later. We ran down the hill onto the sand—bright white sand. There is a twenty dollar bill in the sand—I reach to pick it up—the sand is now dirt, the twenty dollar bill is a one dollar bill, but I see many more bills and pick them up. Now I am running in the sand again. My fiancé is with me. We notice oysters in the wet sand. Waves wash over them. The water is bright turquoise—hills surround the beach.

Sometimes it’s airplanes, sometimes helicopters with their blades barely missing my face as they blow by. I’m unable to avoid them; the crashes follow me. I try to hide behind a rock to avoid flying debris. I smell the pungent smell of burning electronics and fire. I hear people screaming. The scene of the wreckage is very vivid.

I knew that I was dreaming while I was in the dream. The first thing I remember was driving over a little dirt mound with the right wheels. Then, I drove towards a pond surrounded by trees. I drove straight into the pond and it was really deep, so the truck became fully submerged in water. I got out while it was underwater and swam to the front and grabbed the winch cable, to try and winch it out before it got deeper. As everything was happening, it kept going deeper and deeper. I grabbed the cable and tried to swim to the surface.

We flew low and over a river with huge trees on either side. After a short while the engines began to sputter. They died just as we went over the edge of a waterfall. Our pilot tried to restart the engines, but he could not. As we neared the water below, I saw an obelisk/pilar sticking out of the surface. Then we smashed into the water, only it was about 2ft deep. I thought it was odd. I saw a Wendy’s frosty sitting at the bottom of the pilar and then everything went black. I thought to myself “this is what its like to die?

I was walking across sand and could feel the wind blowing it into my legs. I told him we would have to build a fire to survive, which meant we need to make a base of rock for it. I set out looking. Not far off I found a house enclose by a tall brown fence. I was able to reach under the fence and full things from the yard. Things that included a camera and a game about condoms.

They were going to kill him but I kept yelling and the one with the gun must have slipped and two shots wet off but on one died. As he began to load the last bullet he had, I picked up the gun from the group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everyone else driving cars except. My cow had wheels instead of hooves. I don’t remember feeling that this was anything unusual. It was a pleasant sunny day in a big city with large grassy plains in the background. I was feeling quite content until my cow got a flat tire. I was very distressed and panicky and pulled over. Someone ended up offering help. This person was Kevin Bacon, the actor, only in my dream, he was just your average everyday city guy. He said that he would help me, but that I needed to follow him to house first. We walked to his “house” which turned out to be a big abandoned shack/barn in the middle of nowhere. Then I realized we were in the middle of the grassy fields next to a huge lone oak tree. I wasn’t afraid at all while following him to his place, but I remember fear setting in once we got there. He kidnapped me and brought me into his “house” which was old and dirty and smelly inside. Also, it was filled with a bunch of old style, medieval torture devices like a “stretcher” and a guillotine and stuff. He was trying to put me onto the stretcher and I was fighting with him until I ended up jumping and scaring myself awake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were allowed a water break so the team and I went over to our bags. I noticed I had a missed call and message from my dad saying I needed to pick him up from the airport. Without telling anybody, I left practice. I never remember visualizing getting my dad from the airport, but I returned to practice and the coaches were furious. They lectured me about how I can never leave practice without telling them. They made me run the rest of practice.The feelings I experienced were: scared because I knew I would be punished for leaving, disappointed in myself that I didn’t wake up for practice, upset because everyone was mad at me, but over-all stressed about the entire situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little confused because she was running from booth to booth getting tickets and free things and she is usually never so eager, and I found it amusing. I could see the faces and expressions of the people at the booths, and the colorful prizes which were laid out on the tables. The scenery reminded me of the Seattle Center (same layout), with a Ferris wheel and rides in the background. There were also lots of fall leaves. I was happy, but at the same time a little anxious because I was rushing to collect tickets, and I wanted my mom to stay, and I didn’t like the environment (strange fair, darkening season turning to fall). I was waving out of a window at two girls. One I know from school, her name is Laura, and the girl next to her looked very much alike but I understood them to be different girls. Her name was also Laura. The Laura I know in real life waived and started talking to me. I was introduced to the other Laura and we made small talk when the first Laura left. I felt nice and cheerful trying to talk, but at the same time I felt the same anxiety of meeting/ trying to get to know new people. It was the same anxiety I have felt throughout the day, at the beginning of school. Each girl was standing in a square window, and I think one was outlined red and the other was green. I was at an arcade looking at a case of jewelry with my roommate. It was dark, and the environment made me a little uneasy. I also felt determined to make a decision as to what to buy. I looked at a necklace with a gold chain and small bug which was alive and trying to fly away from the chain. On the opposite side of the chain, I later learned, was a tiny, color TV screen. When I tried the necklace on, it had two magnets that attached on either side of my neck, and they choked me. I was scared by the necklace, but also very disappointed I wouldn’t be able to buy it now. (The bug had also died.) I was walking away from a school party at a house which was in my old neighborhood in Seattle and we had friends to used to live in it. I met a guy saying goodbye to people. We started a handshake and got so involved in it that we sat in the side yard and made up our own handshake, which was a lot of slapping and waving our hands. We were laughing a lot, and I felt really included and good to be liked by this new person. I could feel the things I was doing, like stepping in the mud in the yard, throwing sticky objects I found in my hand, and running back and forth from the street to the yard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He thanked me for understanding him, and then for doing as he commanded and then some other equally ambiguous phrase. My mom had heard this, (we though she hadn’t) and she thought that Adam and I had been having sex and doing LSD. She told me something like that it was OK to have sex every so often but not a huge amount and at least could Adam have the courtesy not to reveal it was him. Later, in my living room my mom and I got back to the subject of drugs. I told her I had never done drugs period, although in my head I was trying to think of a way to tell her I had done pot. I was aware that my best friend had smoked pot so it wouldn’t be that big of deal but I couldn’t think of any people to blame for corrupting me that I wouldn’t mind seeing again, since after I told her she’d be distrustful. At another point in the night I was in Adam’s room with another guy and another girl, we were talking about the party scene. Both guys had not pants or boxers on. We were all sitting in chairs. At another point in the night I was watching my bird. He had been moved to a cage in a concert venue or something, the point being there were loud late night notice to keep him up. Also , his cage was tilted and both the food and water bowls were a little too far for him to reach comfortably. So he was almost falling off the perch when he tried to reach them.

When we got inside, there must have been 10 people scattered throughout. I walked in, and sitting near the alter was my friend Chris. I was so excited to see him. I gave him a huge hug. I didn’t know that he was back at SCU, but he explained that he was back for about a week, then he’d fly back to Oxford for the first 2 or 3 weeks of the Pring term and then fly back. I was envisioning this calendar in my head and I remember thinking how crazy and frivolous it seemed to make trips like this so close together. I figured he must be homesick. He showed me the book he was reading – something about grace – the print on the cover was in green cursive and the cover was tan/ beige. He said he was reading with Jesus in the church because it makes the reading less overwhelming. I sat down next to Chris, waiting for mass to start and Meggan sat next to me. Soon his girlfriend showed up and sat a couple of seats away from Chris since the seats next to him were already taken. I was so happy to get to sit next to him and remembered wondering why I hadn’t found him attractive last year he was so good looking now. I was frustrated that I hadn’t jumped on this opportunity while I had the chance. I had forgotten my sweater and the church was a little cold, so I left to go back to my room and get it. I was wearing my Boy Scout shirt and needed my black sweater before mass started. On my way back to the church, I saw Meggan’s roommate, Stephanie, walking towards the church. I was surprised because Steph is an atheist and had never come to mass before. I was glad at first, until she explained that she brought “materials to work on” since she was sure to get bored with all the “religious magic.” I took a deep breath and tried to explain that it would be really disrespectful and distracting to others if she did this and that she should just abort everything – but she was rather flippant about my concern. I felt v. irritated. When we got back into the church it was packed. I looked where Chris was sitting and found that his girlfriend had taken my seat. I felt a twinge of jealousy, but figured she had taken it because she probably thought I had really left and wasn’t going to reclaim it. So Meggan, Steph, and I and my friend Dianna ended up sitting in the very back now. I remember thinking how I’d never sat back there before, but since I had the aisle seat, it wasn’t as bad as I thought. A few minutes into Mass, Steph brought out her materials to work on and I felt v. frustrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was an enjoyable dream though because I yearned to fly in it, so I just tried to let it continue on as it was going- I don't remember trying to change anything. Sometimes I would get up, but sometimes I would just remain on the ground and would have to try again. Once I did get into the air, I no longer had to really flap, but I just soared like a bird.

Despite this, I decided to go back to bed to pass the time before the rest of my family woke up. It was at this point, after I went back to bed that morning, when I experienced my lucid dream. (At this point in my vacation, I was missing about a week of school.) I remember dreaming about being in my class at school. The teacher had brought one of school's televisions into the room, and we were all sitting in our desks, in the darkened classroom, watching some movie on the TV. There was a bit sunlight coming through the window in the corner of the classroom, so it wasn't completely dark. I also remember that we were all only somewhat paying attention to the TV; we were also talking amongst each other, doodling, playing with our school supplies, and disrupting the TV. (I think I had initially recalled what I had dreamt we'd been watching, but regretably I don't remember anymore.) Anyway, at some point during this classroom scene, I became aware that I was dreaming. I remember flying up out of my desk and doing loop-de-loops in air inside the classroom. The ceiling was dark and impossibly high; I was flying perhaps fifteen feet in the air above my classmates. The class was still watching the movie, but they might have also noticed my flying around. (Can't recall exactly when I realized I was dreaming. It could have been before or during the time I dreamt I was flying around in the classroom.) At this point I was definitely aware of my dreaming, and I also remember feeling somewhat euphoric. I wanted to fly around some more, so I flew out the classroom door and then through one of the school's exits near my classroom. I remember flying into the air above the playground, and then noticing one of my classmates standing on the ground looking up at my, so I landed and approached him. (I don't recall whether or not it was recess; I believe there were other kids on the playground, but no one else was especially near us.) I remember thinking I was psychically connected to him at that moment, so I said to him something like, ""Derek! I'm dreaming! I'm in Florida right now, but you're back home! We must be sharing a dream!"" I remember making up a codeword phrase and telling it to him, and then I told him to repeat it back to my in real life when I saw him next, so that we'd know we were communicating telepathically. I don't remember if he replied in the dream, and unfortunately I also no longer recall what the codeword phrase was that I had used, although I remember remembering it for several years later. Next, my family woke me up; I was somewhat annoyed about being roused from such an intense dream, but I got over it. I've remembered most of that dream ever since. Curiously, I was a sort of a shy kid, and I wasn't especially good friends with Derek, (though we weren't enemies either), so I never actually bothered to ask him if he'd had a similar dream and if he'd remembered the codeword phrase. I think I reasoned that if he had dreamt the same thing I had, he would approach me with the codeword phrase. I suppose now I'll never find out if it was a psychic experience, although I certainly imagined that it was at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, from behind a hill came a small hairy loose skinned creature, he appeared to be walking the dog. he was scarey looking but i was not afraid. this is when i realized it was a dream, i noticed how illogical my fear toward the dog was, especially compared to my lack of fear for this unearthly creature. i thought about where i might be headed in this dream and decided i was probably on the way to my mothers house, i carried on my walk. the dog and the creature did not disapear, they were no longer relevant. i walked away fomr them, and that was that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4625,,,,,,ID: gackenbach:lucid:311 details,10-30-2010,"The most recent lucid dream I had is actually a kind of re-occuring dream. Since child-hood, I have had dreams where I'm in a house. Although the house always appears different, has different rooms, furniture, etc., it's always the same house. It's always my parents house; sometimes it's new, fancy, and well-kept. Other times it's old, run down, and dirty. The most recent time I had this dream, it was pleasant. I was alone (I always am in the dream) and had discovered a new and hidden room in the house. I think this is around the time I started to realize I was asleep and dreaming; I don't remember exactly what I decided I would do in the dream, but I think it involved feeling excited that I would get to show my boyfriend this room. I think I did some re-arranging and decorating, and also decided that this is where my mother had decided to put away the books my grandfather had given to me when I was a child - I was extremely happy to have found them. (The books have actually been lost for years). The dream this time was pleasant; I remember being content and excited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4626,,,,,,ID: gackenbach:lucid:40 details,10-30-2010,"I was in a warehouse with my mentor; he showed me the painting of a white owl he had made in response of a watercolour I'd made for him of a brown owl. The brown owl symbolized him and the white one symbolized me. Suddenly, my parents arrived and he became afraid we'd be accused of having a sexual relationship when in reality we simply shared a special bond. I was bothered by his phobia that we might be misinterpreted. It made me feel rejected, and thus lonely. The dream switched to me being driven to a house for a college party. The atmosphere was not one of ""fun"". On the contrary, it was even a bit eerie. To continue, in this part of the dream I was a male, with whom in real life I share significant history with. On my way to the reunion I noted the sky was starry purple, orange, and black. The neighbourhood was luxurious, though there was lustrous black plastic veiling the water of every pool. Inside, the house was dominantly a dark peach tone. I met a girl and we discussed Freud's theory of tongue slips as well as English grammar. At this point the ""observer"" in my dream realized whilst still watching that my subconscious was merely responding to recent reading assignments and pointed out that my dream recollection of language technicalities was quite poor in comparison to that of my psychological studies. Next, she also rejoiced at my mind's ability to at last create a shadow character (a different identity undertaken during sleep) and wondered what my choosing that boy as my alter ego symbolized. At this point, everything became dark; however, I strongly believe this was not the blackness of the inside of my eye lids. The darkness FELT like a dream; furthermore, I had a sense of falling. Then, not even the shadows endured, and there was an extended period of nothing. Upon waking up, a lot of the details were blurry, but I was certain of the events which I previously described. My suspicions are that I became more than one person during the dream and that I was to more than one house. Firstly, I can remember the image of a long brown-haired woman with korean features laying on the ground in some form of predicament also in a peach environment. Secondly, I can remember my wearing red robes as I imagined Offred from The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood wear as I carried a grey flag and marched across an outdoors basketball court within small group of kids ( they were clad in the same way) on a cloudy day. I remember the ""observer"" pointing out how marches such as this were important to me in my elementary school back when I lived in Mexico. Also, I might have been in a vaguely dark beach home setting which has appeared in my dreams before, and there is the possibility that at the end, the girl I spoke to was me PHYSICALLY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They made no sign to me or sound. Suddenly a great fear rose up in me and I jumped down from the windowsill and joined them running with them in the same direction away from the Sandia mountains in Albuquerque. There were people of all ages, races, and both sexes running. I particularly remember a boy about my age. He may have looked at me when I joined them but said nothing. I ran with them in silence for a long time before I realized that they weren't ever going to stop and that no one would explain to me what we were running from. Slowly and with difficulty I made myself stop running. I turned to look behind me, assuming that what we were running from had to be behind us. Above the Sandia mountains against the night sky were great hands outlined in light almost like fireworks. The hands were preparing the Eucharist. They poured the wine and placed the host on the Paten. As I watched the people parted around me to continue running.

I dreamt I was in the house of a neighbor who had, along with his daughter in real life, sexually molested me. I was in their living room with the Samoyed husky who belonged to my family. He was called Oso. His full name was Oso de Blanco Grande (big white bear). The room was entirely empty, the windows were open and curtains were blowing in a gentle summer breeze. I remember enjoying the look of the trees outside the window and the translucent yellow curtains. The sun was shining on a wooden floor so highly polished that Oso and I could see ourselves in it. It was as reflective as a mirror. Oso and I walked to the middle of the floor. I knelt down, sitting back on my heels, and Oso sat beside me. We stared at our reflections. It was a truly peaceful and loving moment between us. Slowly, however, as we watched, Oso's reflection began to change. It seemed to swirl and splinter gradually, interesting to watch at first. I looked at Oso and saw that the changes were only occurring in his reflection, not him. My reflection didn't change at all. The changes in his reflection became more pronounced, splintering, revolving, and becoming little by little more and more malevolent. I began to be upset and afraid and Oso started to claw and whine at his reflection. I began to beat his reflection with my hands, not hard at first. But as the changes appeared to change from malevolence to outright evil I began to hit Oso's reflection harder and harder and began to shout at it and eventually scream at it. Oso stood up and barked, snapped and clawed at his reflection even more forcefully. For a long time this had no effect. I was beginning to feel exhausted when I noticed that little by little the swirling was slowing and the splintering decreasing. Oso and I kept up our efforts until slowly, very slowly his reflection returned to normal. At last it did, and Oso sat down again. We stared at our reflections for a long while to make sure, I think, that everything was OK again. I remember feeling fearful for him. Then we looked into each others eyes. A peaceful feeling returned, even a victorious feeling, but also a feeling of complete exhaustion and grief.",,,College Degree+,,,,,,,,,,Prog,35-54,,,,1-2/Mo,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,50-64,White,No/NS,2,Married,$75-100K,West,Married,Married Female,White,Protestant

It was a perfectly lovely day and we had the windows open to enjoy the early summer morning coolness. When we approached the downtown area where the cathedral church was, it was a very industrial area with buildings that looked like factories all around. We parked in the parking lot behind a factory and scaled the pipes and duct work on the back of the building, using electric cables to help pull us upward to the roof. Once there we crossed the roof to a tall pine tree on the other side, and here it now appeared that the building was indeed a cathedral church in the old English style. We each took our turn climbing down the pine tree to the grass below, dusted ourselves off and proceeded into the large Oak doors of the stone and mortar Cathedral Church of St. Mark. We attended the service and I particularly enjoyed the pipe organ music and the colors streaming in through the beautiful stained-glass windows - the way they reflected off the curve of my eyeglasses as I held them in my hand and played with them. Once the brief service was over and most people left, I went up and sat down at the keyboard of the organ and began to play at the behest of the church organist. I played the Widor toccata. The organist lauded me with high praise for being a child prodigy. We left the church sanctuary to go to the reception room where people always gather to socialize after the church service. Everyone was in tuxedos and fine dresses sipping champagne or cups of coffee. We said a few hello's around the room and then went out the front of the building to the large pine tree, where we climbed again to the roof. Across the roof we found our footing on the ducts and pipes and climbed down to our awaiting car. Then we drove home along the same Elm-lined boulevard as I sat in the middle between my parents and watched the dappled light stream through the trees. Then I awoke.

I walked down a hall in what appeared to be a hotel or a building suitable for hosting conferences. To my right, there was a candy machine with four different types of chocolate bars, all wrapped in the same shiny, red foil, each with a different name -- but very generic looking. I made a mental note to come back and have one of the candy bars that had been left outside the machine in a crystal bowl -- as if there had been an overflow when the dispenser was refilled, and the surplus had been left on the side for anyone with a sweet tooth to take. As I walked on, I came to an atrium or sunroom, beautifully decorated and filled with natural light. My friend, Susan, was sitting on one of the couches, reading my journal. It was then that I instinctively knew we were on a religious retreat, and that the journal had been provided by the retreat coordinator so that participants could record their experience for the duration of their spiritual getaway, but also so that other people at the retreat could write something about each other in their journals. My first thought was, ""Susan was invading my privacy,"" but, then, I thought, ""Well, maybe she had been writing some nice words in my journal -- I can't wait to read them."" She said with a smile, ""Besides the journal, there is something else for you."" And, she pointed toward a gorgeous bouquet of long-stemmed pink roses in a beautiful vase. I immediately found the card to see who had sent me such a magnificent gift. I was surprised and pleased to see the names of Laura and George Bush written in ink, not the automated signatures from an autopen. The card I held then turned into a three-prong folder, the kind I used to buy for my children's projects in school, with a series of pages full of patriotic information, and why they were grateful to me. My interpretation: the red wrapping of the candy bars signifies communism, and the gratitude gift of flowers from George and Laura tell me that I have been sending too many anti-communist forwards.",,,No College Degree,,,,,,,,,,Cons,55-69,,,,Weekly+,,,,,,,,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,50-64,White,Yes,8,Married,$100+,East,Married,Married Female,Hisp,Catholic

5048,,,,,,,05-13-2010,"(572) Last night I dreamt it was the middle of the night and a helicopter landed on Cassandra’s house. I think that I felt like the reason why they did is because they had some kind of emergency and they couldn’t go any further, so then like emergency landed on Cassandra’s house. Then a plane emergency landed on our house, because the plane had to rescue whoever was in the helicopter. And it was kind of funny because we all thought it was going to be bad and, you know, when the plane landed on our house, it kind of knocked a few boards loose, but it didn’t really flatten the house like sometimes we say it will. I’m trying to think. And it was a general scene where all of us were up kind of late, it was past 11:00 or 12:00 at night, and I think it was like one other person, it was one of the first nights Mom and Dad were back in town. And I think Dad was talking on the phone and Mom was doing something like shuffling papers on the dining room table. And I was up late, I was watching something on TV. And then I don’t remember what happened ______ but next thing I knew it was Halloween and I didn’t have like the stuff set up like I usually do. Oh, I know, part of this was when we were up late, I was on the porch, and it was another one of those dreams where we listened to the boom box and I couldn’t shut it off when I realized that Mom & Dad were home. And I couldn’t even take the batteries out. It was the funniest thing. And so I turned it all the way down and it still could be heard. And then the next thing I knew, it was Halloween and I didn’t have my stuff set out like I usually do. And I was upstairs digging some more stuff out, and next thing I knew, the doorbell rang, and it was people {trick-or-treaters} and you know how you give each people two things of candy in their bag _______________, well this kid said, “No, I want a big one like my brother; I want a blue one.” And I said, “Okay, I don’t think I have one, but you can look.” And he looked and looked, “No, you don’t have one.” And so I said, “Well, have a good _____,” and he left. And that’s all I think there was to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But she didn’t actually have to go to the doctor, she could do it at home. So get this: She had to float a bucket in the toilet, and put the phone in the bucket so that whatever she would pee in the bucket would go over the phone to the doctor’s office! In this dream, I had to go to the toilet. I remembered that the bucket was there, and I was just going to take it out. But the bucket tipped, and it got full of water, and the phone got wet. So I took it out quickly and put it on a side, and I was wondering if I was going to get an electric shock. See, this was the kitchen phone, and it was still, like, attached to the wall. But how we had it in the bathroom, I don’t know, go figure. I think that’s all there was to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5050,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(650) Last night I dreamt that I was on a cruise. Well, actually when it started, Sheryl and Sam were here and it was a Sunday, I can remember, and I can remember thinking that it was the only day that I was going to be totally free and not have a lot of stuff to do. And we were, this thing was going to be gone all day and it was going to eat up my one day that I didn’t have a whole lot to do. And I was thinking how I needed to get stuff done, and I was at the monitor doing my paperwork and stuff. And the car with Sheryl and Sam and Mom and Dad pulled away and I thought to myself, “Okay, they’re gone,” but I was still kind of waffling in my mind as to whether I wanted to go or not, and the man from the cruise line company kind of talked me into going, I guess. And so I don’t know how I got there, but next thing I knew, I had caught up with them and was at the dock and we were walking down the gang plank for this great big boat, which was all wood. It was like a wooden boardwalk that you walk on, like when you’re at a nature park. It had all the railings and everything. And actually when I was on the boat, next thing I was looking out and I was seeing like all these mountains and things and seagulls flying around in the mountains. And I turned to somebody next to me and I was like, “Where are we?” And they said, “We’re in Australia.” And I was flabbergasted. And they said that we were going to go to Africa and see animals there. And I’m trying to think – I don’t really remember interacting that much with Sheryl and Sam or Mom and Dad. I just remember there were these things where, you know, there were these certain moments when they advised everybody to go and strap down because the boat was going to be rocking, kind of like they do on an airplane when they’re going to be taking off and landing. But there were times you could kind of walk around or lay down on one of those benches or something like that. And that’s all I can remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5051,,,,,,,05-13-2010,"(604) Last night I was having a very vivid dream that I remember quite a bit of. I dreamt that I used to take a lot of rides with Allison and Corie in their car, and for some reason _______ it needed fixing. And for some reason they wanted me to pay for it. And they were going to, for some reason they dropped me off at some strange intersection and they went on their way. And they said, “You can go to the shop for us and let them know we’re coming and tell them all about it, okay?” And I said, “Sure.” And I kind of wandered around aimlessly, not knowing where I was going for a few minutes, and then I got it in my head that I could work with my monocular at street signs, and I had the address on a card that they had given me. It was an AMCO shop and it was at 50-something, and I was on 49th Street, so I knew I had to go one over, and sure enough, there it was. So I went in and I told them that Allison and Corie were coming, and then for some reason Mom met me at the shop because I didn’t know how I was going to get home and there she was; she showed up. And next thing I know we were walking and walking and we ended up at Damon’s Landing and there’s this park and we were walking down the boardwalk, and first we came through like a restaurant, and on stage there was some music, and there was like a one-man band who had like a drum machine and a guitar, and Mom said he was in a parrot costume, like a parrot head fan. And I was kind of hungry. I wanted us to sit down and eat at the shop there because I was looking out and there was like a fence and we could see the blue, blue water. And we kept walking down the boardwalk and there were these steep inclines you’d walk down. And then we came to these stairs where we could walk down to the water, and we walked down and we stood there. And it was just really blue and it smelled really nice and wonderful. And there were other people swimming. And in this dream I was wearing jeans and some kind of long-sleeve shirt, and I thought, “Well, gee, if I was wearing less clothes, I would jump right in.” And I said to Mom, “You have to tell me where Damon’s Landing is in relation to the other things I know,” and she said, “It’s more southern.” We walked a little more and I said, “You need to tell me where it’s at in relation to other things,” and she said, “I don’t think so; I don’t want to.” And that made me really mad, and I got the drift because she said it was southern that it was near Mid-town and she didn’t want me to go there, and she didn’t want to say it in front of all these people. That made me so mad, I wanted to push her in the water. And then I woke up. Also I’m remembering something that came before this whole thing, before I woke up to go to the bathroom. I was back at my high school and I was in the food court, like the outside cafeteria thing and that you could just have a school play or something. And Mom came by and I was at, Mom was going to come by on the tandem bike and pick me up, but I was standing around talking to Andrea and Crystal and a couple other people, and they were going to go for a ride downtown. And they were going to just sort of hang around and get to town and have a night on the town. And I was wondering about whether or not to just say I would go with them and get Mom to go back home. But while we were waiting, they were saying some really horrible things about these people they knew and what they did and, you know, how they were going to get drunk and stuff like that. And I figured I just wanted to get away from them, so next thing I knew, Mom showed up and I don’t really remember riding home. I just remember being home, being so scared, and laying with her in bed and thinking to myself how much I really didn’t want to be out on the town with Andrea and Crystal getting into all kinds of trouble. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5052,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(620) I had a frustrating dream last night. I dreamt that I was at my tech school for a guest performance. I don’t know how I got to Union City, but I think I took a DART cab all the way. What do you know about that? Speaking of cabs, I actually took a cash cab to work today because I forgot to set another one. I was all wigged out yesterday. So anyway, I took a DART cab all the way to Union City in this dream and I was at my tech school and I was sitting in the coffee shop and having dinner with somebody really, really famous, I don’t know who. I don’t really have any kind of a name __________. It wasn’t anybody whose name I would recognize. And he was just kind of making small talk before the presentation, and he was saying how overwhelmed he was by everybody wanting him to hear this stuff. And somehow I took to talking to him, I don’t know, I’m just special that way. I have a way to draw people in sometimes, probably because I’m so precocious, probably more than I should be. So we started talking and I started blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all about me and stuff. And he kind of seemed to like talking to me, so we talked a little bit. And he said, “Well, you seem so enthusiastic. Why aren’t you doing it now?” And I said, “Well, first of all, I live in my home town,” and I said, “If I were up here, I would doing it more, but I’m in my home town,” and I told him all this stuff my parents say and how they kind of pooh-poohed the whole thing, and how they’re, you know, kind of gave them a little bit of a sob story which is very unprofessional of me. And then he started talking about other things and how I could eventually maybe get back to it, and I said, “I know the theory really well in my head, I know about ______ _____. The problem for me is finding out how to make the teeny piece of equipment do what it’s supposed to do in a timely fashion.” And he said, the whole rest of the crowd got there, and it was like time for me to stop talking and pull back and let someone else in. And the next scene flipped to when we were done with the presentation – apparently the whole thing was in the coffee shop. It didn’t look like the one that I remember, but the floor was white, so it must’ve been the one I remember. The one I remember was like in the back of a building and it was really, really open and airy. And this one was kind of closed up like a little store front shop. So it was after the presentation and he said, “Well, how are you getting home?” And I said, “Well, I don’t know. I’m thinking I’m going to have to call my parents.” And for a minute he kind of did a ________ and said, “Well, why would you have to do that?” And it just seemed odd. Sometimes Dad says the most odd things at the most odd times. So he said, “Well, let me call my wife real quick.” And he made this call and he was talking a little bit, and then he said, “Well come on, let’s go.” And I can’t remember how it happened, but I think we were walking, and he said, “Well, I could use _________ in the house anyway because I’ve got paint fumes coming up from the floor” or something. I think he meant to say that he was having painting and all kinds of stuff going on at his house. So for some crazy reason, I don’t think I even called home, but Mom showed up, of all things. And she’s like, “Well, come on, Jess, let’s go.” And I said, “Well no, I’m going to ride with so and so,” I can’t even remember his name. He’s really famous, he’s a sound _____. I want to ride with him and I want to have more of a report.” And Mom said, “Well, you don’t really know him,” and this and that and the other, and I just had the biggest hissy fit you can ever imagine. I was, once I got the drift that she thought she had to save me from that situation, I let loose. I was yelling and screaming and running after her, and trying to throw things at her. I threw, when we were having this scene, we were at a park. I’m starting to remember it better now. I think this sound man and I were walking in the park to get to his car, and I said that I remembered that park because it looked like one of the ponds at my complex. So we were at this park and Mom and I were fighting and having our fits. And I threw my phone and my purse in the pond, and then I just threw myself on the ground and was rolling down the hill, and I knew I wasn’t really going to go too far too fast, but I was. And then I was walking in the shallow water, and then it was nightfall and then I kind of – actually I think I was at home when night fell. Somehow I got home. I must’ve ridden home anyway, and I didn’t know where my phone or anything was, probably because it was still in the lake! But I realized that I needed to call my tech school and let – I think his name was Nick – I needed to let Nick know that I got home, but that I still wanted to talk to him some more sometime. And so that he would know that he didn’t have to wait for me any more, and that I didn’t drop off the face of the earth, and apologized to him for the whole thing. So I realized that I couldn’t call 407 on a land line because we don’t have long distance any more, and I was messing it all up and not really doing the right thing, and in this dream I couldn’t even call the 1-800 number for Admissions. I used to be able to call the 1-800 number for Admissions and they’d transfer me to whatever department I asked for because when I first got there, I didn’t memorize the new number for a while, so I would just call the Admissions number. So anyway, I didn’t talk to anybody, but a while later I heard this ringing and ringing and I followed my ears and I found my cell phone and I answered it. And the lady said, “It’s a Pissa (?)” and she said it was a lady from the desk at my tech school. And I was just starting to tell her about what happened and to apologize and pass the message to Nick for me. And then I woke up. Oh, how frustrating, and how tiring!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5055,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(591) Last night I had a really crazy dream. It was something to do with being by the water, and something to do with the mermaid story, but I can’t quite remember that part. The part that I do remember is that Uncle Carl was going to set off some kind of great big – it wasn’t actually a bomb that would be intended to hurt people, but it was like a great big, large-scale loud firework thing, mainly to put on a show out in the middle of the water or something. And I remember in this dream we were in the kitchen, and he was testing one in the back yard, and it made this great big ba-boom and it had this flash of light. And I remember it was so loud it hurt, and I mean I don’t know how that could manifest in a dream, but anyway he was trying to do another one that was going to be like twice as big, only this one was going to be at the waterfront. And he like set it up on a little boat or a dock or something, or a timer so that it would go off at a certain time, and I just remember we were with him on our bikes, and we were going to a restaurant and walking along the water and stuff, and I always had this fear in the back of my mind that when this thing goes off, it’s going to be really loud and I don’t want it to hurt my years. So what am going to do about that? And how can I the farthest away as I can? And in this dream all I could think was Beethoven when Napoleon bombed Vienna, the rest of his hearing went. And I kept thinking, “I don’t want to end up deaf like Beethoven.” And I think where we ended up in this dream is I was, it was dark and we were by the comfort station, which is like a brick bathroom place downtown. And we were on a blanket and I think we had a little fire going, like a campfire, like a mini one, and I had my big thick cans from my tech school and I was going to put them on, thinking that it would block out the sound of that bomb thing. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5056,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(576) Last night I had three dreams. The first I dreamt that I was at the farm cottage, I was up in my relative’s home town. But it was on this acre or two, I mean instead of being in the middle of absolute nowhere, it was on this acre or two property, and we had a gravel, stone driveway like Grammy had. And it even had wooden things in the gravel, almost like a wooden boardwalk up to the house. . Anyway, we lived in a little community, kind of almost like one of those ______ Vision things, and all of the properties kind of looked like this. And they were spaced out more than subdivisions usually are. And I didn’t even get the feeling like we were in my relative’s home town all the time. It felt like a warmer climate. And so basically, we were milling around and doing different things. The inside looked quite a bit like our house. Let’s see, click, I can’t remember any real action in this, but at some time, I felt like we were riding around in the truck, around different places, and other times we were walking. And everybody was getting along pretty well, but I just felt that we were all too close together, you know, I’m used to having lots of space, and here, everybody was practically on top of me all the time, just like it was when we were at the farm. But yet the land was so beautiful and I was so happy to just have a break from everything. I believe the house had power, but not as much as you’d usually have. If I had to put it in technical terms, I’d say that the fuse box was rated for, like, 5 or 6 amperes at the most, but of course, I didn’t think that in this dream. It had lights, and we could run our sound system in the living room like at home, but it didn’t have, like, air conditioners and washers and dryers and all that stuff. So I was thinking to myself that I really wouldn’t mind being at the farm by myself for a while. And by the end of this dream – Oh, I know, somewhere in the middle, Mom was supposed to take me out through the back of the house. See, I had only been coming in and out of the front of the house, but Mom wanted to show me the back of the house, because it was right on this beautiful body of water. But she never did show me. Then, Terri popped in and was yacking and talking. There was something about bread, she was putting bread in the toaster. We were having this discussion about wheat bread versus white bread. It was a bagel, it was a white bread bagel. And then, we were riding in the truck again. Then, we were walking somewhere, it was very urban. Like when we take the bike to my bank and we ride under the overpass and see all the homeless people, and sometimes there’s construction. It’s just so loud, you’ve got the cars, and the echo and the construction equipment, it’s such an assault on the senses. It wasn’t that loud in this dream, but it looked like that. We were walking to some store with an older couple. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5057,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(590) I had a dream about the red boat that we used to have. I dreamt that Sandra and the kids were here, but for some reason there was only Sandra. There must have been ________ when Dad was at work, because he wasn’t here. And Mom and I and Sandra decided that we were going to take the boat and go to the beach, and so I think – I can’t remember if we hitched it up to the car, or if we tied it on the top of the car, but we did one of the above. And I suggested that we take the green truck and just flop the boat in the back of the truck, but Mom said it wouldn’t fit. And so I don’t really remember us riding in the boat; I just remember us being at the beach. And I remember swimming in the water. And I remember kind of being _______ boat. And when I was swimming in the water, wouldn’t you know, it started to rain. And we were gathering up all our stuff and we were going to run and seek shelter. And, wouldn’t you know, the boat was anchored and for some reason it had this odd back-up alarm kind of sound that would go off if you left it unattended for too long. Wouldn’t you know it started happening, and Mom had to go and shut that off. And we were getting to pack it up and bring it home, I think, and I think we packed it up and brought it home because of the rain. And then, when we got it home, I think parts of it kind of got scattered all over the house. I think Mom put the boat in the bathtub outside and for some reason the motor and other parts got put on the old sleeping couch, where the organ is now in the living room. And some other kind of piece got put in my bathroom upstairs in my tub. That was pretty crazy. And so I think maybe in this dream they were going to work on the boat motor or something and I didn’t want to be around to hear it because it is so loud. And so I decided I was going to make myself disappear, and in this dream – not literally, you know – I was going to take a walk. Dad says, “Make myself disappear” or “make yourself scarce” or something when he means just go somewhere else. So I had these little pink sandals in my dream, and they had like glitter on them. They were the ultimate dorky little girl things. So I put them on and I started out the front door, and it’s one of those things where I couldn’t really run, but I was really trying to, and I was trying to get away. And inside I could hear them, Dad was telling Mom that we have to __________ crank up the motor and then I managed to get pretty far away, almost to Allison’s before I heard it faintly, and then I decided I was going to take a walk all around the neighborhood and hopefully be gone until they were done. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5059,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(644) Last night I was having a dream that I was being given a chance to play at the Pizza Factory or someplace like that, and I was sitting at home trying to work up some theater organ arrangements that I hadn’t touched in a god’s age. And I was trying to be wildly optimistic about that would go and what was going to come of it, that I could whip up five or six arrangements in like a week. And at home my organ console was a horseshoe like a real theater organ, but it sounded the same, and I was thinking how I hadn’t even had the tremulants on in months or years. And for some reason at home the floor was crooked. It slanted down. You started at the north end of the living room and the coffee table was up high, and then as you went further to the south, the floor just slanted and slanted and slanted. So I remember sitting at the organ and feeling like I was tilted for some reason and that was why. And I remember thinking, “Gee, this is strange. I wonder if our house is going to collapse or cave in.” And I was working on an arrangement from “The Little Mermaid” and I had this drawing that it was like already printed and I had colored it. It was like two crabs, it was like Sebastian and these other two orange crabs and Ariel, and there were like hearts and flowers in the background and it was all in a heart-shaped cut-out of a paper. And I had it up on the organ to kind of inspire me, I guess. And I was remembering a story that wasn’t really in the movie, but apparently from some sequel that I had made up in my imagination, like I always do in dreams. And apparently this sequel was where Ariel was a human and then she came back down to the sea and she was Sebastian and they had a whole big reunion and everything. And I can’t remember what more there was to it. I just remember sitting there trying to work feverishly on these arrangements and trying to get them all in in a certain amount of time and the floor being crooked and things kind of going whacko and people were coming in and kind of disturbing me, and I was wishing they’d all just get lost and let me practice and work without any interruptions.

And it must have been North Bend Beach, I think. We were swimming around and playing in the water. And I was noticing that where it was shallow there was a lot of shells and poky barnacles and things, and it wasn’t really that smooth at the bottom. And so we went deeper, but I wanted to stay close to them. And then they said they wanted to go and do something else. They had a dog or something they were going to walk. I think it was like a beige-ish-brownish dog, kind of like the dog Tiffany Sandra used to have. And so they went to do that, but I said I was going to swim so more, so I did. And then I got out of the water and I went into the like the little beach house thing to use the restroom. And I was walking around and I was wanting some food, and I went to this vending machine where you put cash in the machine and you get like a card, like a gift card that has like a plastic with money on it. And when mine came out, it wasn’t like a credit card like you expect; it was like a mini CD. And I thought to myself, “What am I going to do with this? Who would take this?” And then I thought it might be time to reconnect with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam, so I called them on my phone, but and then I realized at that time I was totally naked, and I was like walking down the beach or running down the beach, kind of covering my chest. And I sat on the bench for a minutes kind of waiting for them. And I figured, “Well, I’m not going to sit out here totally naked. I’m getting back in the water.” So I did, and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5065,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(616) Last night I was having a really strange dream. Actually we were riding around doing errands with Elise. It was me and Mom and Dad and Elise were all in the car, and there was someone else with us. And we were riding around to different stores and things, and it was time to get ourselves some food. And for some reason Dad knew of this van that would be parked by the police station, and this van would have like all kinds of food rations and little things that they give to prisoners. And for some reason, somehow, they were going to let us have some, if it was anything we really wanted, right? I mean, it was so, they had like little spools of thread and little socks, little containers of food and just diddly things in different drawers and things. And we got Elise some things from there, and someone was telling us the story of this food that fell in the mud and how they took like thousands of bacteria processes and things and somehow cleaned it up, and they don’t know what they did or how they did or if it was safe. They just know they did it. And next we _________ parking lot and for some reason there was a fire truck, and for some reason Dad had to move it. And he said something about, “Go over to one side,” like over around to the left, “and go out of the parking lot and wait for me over somewhere else.” Well, for some reason, instead of going left, I went right, and he was backing the truck up. And I thought that he wanted us to get in the truck so that we could keep going. So I went around the back of the truck over to the passenger side, and I was so close to getting run over. The truck was like touching me, almost about to knock me over. It was moving slowly, slowly. So I just climbed onto the bumper for lack of a better way to say it. I just climbed onto it and hung on so that he could do all his maneuvering and I wouldn’t get run over. And he kept turning it and stuff, and eventually I managed to tap on the door. And I don’t remember what happened after that. I don’t even remember us getting back in our car to go home. Then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5066,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(586) I had a very brief dream last night. I dreamt that I was in Cassandra’s house and that somehow she had this upstairs, and it was sort of like Uncle Carl’s upstairs in that all the floors were wood. It was open and spacious and there was lots of natural light. And there were like different rooms. There were like three or four rooms up there. The foyer was like huge. And then there was like an office, a bathroom, and then like two bedrooms. And as I was up there, we were like visiting with some people that I didn’t really know. And as I was up there, it was hard for me to tell whether it was Cassandra’s second floor or whether it was our third floor. But I think at the beginning of the dream it was hers, Cassandra’s, and then at the end of the dream it was ours. And whoever owned it was renting it out because who would need all that space up there, right? And there was a family living up there. And I’m starting to remember something about the beginning of this dream now. And actually I think we were supposed to do something and I kind of ran away and escaped up there so I could have some privacy and be alone. And I think I was in a room that was like my bedroom, except it was bigger and it was like cold. I mean there were like vents in the floor and the air-conditioning was coming up from the floor and it was cold. And I turned on a radio and I laid down in the bed, and the next thing I knew I was out in the foyer and I was visiting with these people. And then a little while later I got the feeling that maybe Mom and Dad owned the place, and one of the ladies said, “Evelyn, could you please turn the air down? It’s cold up here. I have a child in the shower right now.” And I can’t remember what she said. I think she said, “Oh, well, it’s not been cold up here, what are you talking about?” And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5067,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(581) I was having some pretty interesting dreams last night. First of all I dreamt that Mom & I were riding bikes, and we were going down to the beach. And there was some kind of festival with a lot of music going on at the green point or straub park or something like that. . We were walking along the shore and we were swimming in the water, we were walking along, even when we were walking along the waterfront, and apparently there was some place where we could get down by the water to swim. And I was saying we should go over a little bit closer to where the festival was so that we could still hear the music. And we had some kind of picnic, and I’m trying to remember, I think before that we were at some kind of show and there were these girls in all these pink dresses and they were like singing or dancing or something. And Dad was there, and I think Mr. Dawson was there, and Mom was there. And we were all going to go to a park or something, and I just ______, “Oh that’s so boring and so ___________ always do that. I don’t want to do that again.” And that’s when Mom and I went to the beach. I was thinking how going to the beach with Dad would be so very boring, but with just Mom & I, it was pretty fun. In this dream, the weather was very nice, too. Then I can’t remember any songs that I really recognized, but they were playing, like, oldies songs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5068,,,,,,,,"(632) Last night I was having some kind of scary dreams. The first I can’t really remember. It was one of those nights where I know I slept, but I slept really lightly and I kept waking up. So the first dream, I dreamt that I was putting on a puppet show and there were these really, really funny-looking cootie-bug like type puppets, and I was making them jump up and down and say stupid nonsense things and whatever else like that. And then I woke up and was awake for about half an hour. And then I went back to sleep and I dreamt that I was on a plane, one of those little planes like we flew on when we went to Key West – I don’t know exactly what you call it, but more private than commercial. And for some reason these dreams about flying, I have this sort of nondistinct sort of relationship between being in a plane and being in a car. And it was kind of the same thing, and the way it usually goes is I’m in a car and I’m riding with somebody, and then I realize that I’m flying; or maybe it’s the other way around, or, you know. But this time I was with two or three other people and we were coming back from some kind of conference, and I was trying to get home. And apparently we had to land like at some strange airport that wasn’t where I wanted to be. And it was like, we’re in this big building, but we’re going down water slides and stuff, and we’re kind of splashing and playing in the water. And we’re apparently trying to pass our layover because I had to wait like four and a half hours before I could get on another plane. Then I realized I was stark naked and there’s all these people around and I was thinking, “What are going to say about me going on a plane stark naked?” And then I woke up and it was some other hour, I think it was about 7:00. And then I went back to sleep, unintending, and I dreamt that I not only didn’t finish my degree at the college, but I had just been let go, and that people were saying that when I was working there, I falsified documents and made things look so that they weren’t right. And apparently according to them, I didn’t do in on purpose; I did it because I just wasn’t attentive to detail and couldn’t really read everything I was supposed to. And I don’t know exactly all the details, but it was something like that. And it was almost like being in high school, because the two campuses were sort of combined again. And again, I was stark naked and I was walking around, and apparently – I don’t know – I think I had scheduled a cab or I didn’t connect with a cab after I had been let go, and I was there wandering around aimlessly with nothing to do and I had like three hours before I could go home. And I was like laying down in a sunny patch by some bushes and I was like crawling along the ground and hoping nobody would see me. And then I woke up. That was bizarre, and how bizarre and how bizarre!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5069,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(624) Last night I was having a kind of a creepy dream. Sam was in town and we were getting ready to go to Disneyland. And Dad wasn’t going again. It was me and Mom and Sam. And at first I was thinking that I didn’t want to go either because I was remembering the nightmare we had with the Morgan family. But as this kind of went along, I realized that I wanted to go too, that we’d probably have a lot of fun. And let’s see, first of all, weirdest of all, I dreamt that our house had heat sensors and alarms like public buildings do, and if I colored with a marker or a crayon in the house, even on the porch, it would sound like a fire alarm in a public building was going off. So I had to be really, really careful and if I wanted to draw or color, I actually had to go out in the front yard. And I was making something that I don’t remember what, and then I’m trying to remember what else. I think we were supposed to go to bed early so that we could get up early the next morning and get on the road, but Sam and Mom and I stayed up yakking and yakking and yakking all night pretty much, and I don’t remember what we were talking about – funny stuff, kind of ________________ and just kind of bonding, I guess. Now normally in the past couple years we wouldn’t really know what to say that much, but here in this dream we seemed to have a lot to say. We were just kind of goofing around. Sam was laying on the couch, and I was sitting on him, like when I was a little girl, and we were kind of wrestling and playing and stuff, and Mom was on the sleeper couch. There wasn’t an organ yet in this dream. And I think I showed Sam Big Bird and he really liked it, but then I remembered that Dad was sleeping in the bedroom and I had left him in the bedroom there because I thought that nobody was home, and I was just hoping that Dad wouldn’t wake up and see him, but he did. And he woke up – it was kind of like 5:00 o’clock in the morning, his normal time to get up, and I guess we had kind of been up all night, and he woke up and just sort of casually carried Big Bird out and put him on the sleeper couch and I was so embarrassed because I didn’t want Dad to see him. And I was kind of, while Dad was in the bathroom, I was kind of talking to Sam about maybe he could convince Dad that it was his, and then I realized that Sam is probably under a lot more pressure to be grown up and manly than I am. So I don’t really remember how that went. And then, let’s see, and then I went upstairs and I was putting on orange tights like they weren’t really tight per se, but they were like knee-high socks and they were bright orange. And I was going to wear these goofy brownish shoes. And I was getting dressed to get out on the road, and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5071,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(633) Last night I was having a dream that some orchestra conductor or somebody was going to put on this great big, huge, giant oratorio that was like really really long and had like 100 singers and 100 orchestra people and stuff. It was the classic late Romantic gargantuan m______ sing, although I had the feeling like the composer was a rogue like Handel or somebody. And the goal was for them to do this totally without any electrical power of any kind from the grid. So apparently I think they were going to put up, they weren’t going to have any amplification for one thing. And I saw lots of lights on the music stands and there were like Christmas lights along the stage, and they said that they were run on solar energy. And I was supposed to participate in this thing, but I really didn’t have a score, I didn’t know what we were doing, I was just going to kind of bumble along. I was supposed to play piano, but quite frankly I thought I could just sort of hide in the back and pretend because there would be so much going on, nobody would hear me anyway. So basically the little bit of action in this dream, I was in some foggy stuff I don’t remember. One thing I really do remember was I was behind this huge, huge, huge bleacher thing that was really risers that went like – you know how most chorus risers have like three or four tiers! Well, this one had like 10 or 15 tiers to it. It was like really, really high and really, really steep. And I was thinking, “Gee, the people up there can’t be afraid of heights in order to do this thing.” And I was just thinking, “Gee, I hope this thing doesn’t fall on me back here,” because I was like back behind it. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was back at the media building at my high school, and I was going to some English class. And I knew that there would be a fire drill scheduled in the afternoon when I was in that class, but I had some homework that I really needed to turn in, so I went to this elevator. It was this really rickety elevator that wobbled and wobbled as you went up. And I was really scared in that elevator. But I got up to the class and took out and handed in my stuff and there was a substitute teacher and I just told her I’m visually impaired, and this is my ? schedule. And I need to already be outside so that I don’t get lost in the shuffle. But it was close to the time change and my clock hadn’t been changed an hour later, so I kept having to adjust in my mind and I was like doubting myself. And then I finally grabbed my books and ran down the stairs a few minutes before it was supposed to be 2:30. And I think I just went up to the lawn in the front of the school and sat down, and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5073,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(651) Last night I had a dream that we were having a party at the house in the front yard, and I was setting up the Peavey system and the keyboard. And I had brought the Peavey system around front and we had our yard decorated with the Christmas lights and everything, and Mom and Dad were kind of giving me trouble as to where I was going to put it. And I had it out there and I was trying to deal with a bunch of other things at the same time. And I was going to bring the keyboard out and I was going to play. And then there was something to do with the fact that I had the Peavey system out there and it started to rain, which that’s not really surprising that this showed up because that’s what happened at the Barrett’s place. Thank goodness we had a tarp in the truck. And then I dreamt that I was at the fruit stand, of all places, and we were having like a class for kids and there were people on the floor that were coloring, and there were people that were dancing and playing instruments and things. And I had brought Big Bird and set him on top of one of the shelves up high where the fruits were. And I was thinking that I would show him to the kids if anybody seemed interested, but at the time they were all doing their own thing. And then some of the – I don’t know – some of the kids said they had a monkey. Some of the kids said they had a dancing monkey or something, and that T. Rowe Price was a company that made stuff like that still. And that was all I can remember and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5079,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(583) Last night I had spme pretty strange dreams. First, the one I can remember best, is that Mom and I were in the airport and we were going somewhere. Actually I can’t remember where we were going. ____ leaving town as if we were going to my relative’s home town. And I had to go to the bathroom, actually, we both did. For some reason, we went in the same stall _______kind of take turns going and we chattered and took turns going______. So that’s what we did in this airport dream.______ Well, we heard this message come over the intercom, talking to some other person, telling this other person that they had better go quickly, not just sit around, or the toilet would flush automatically before they were ready. And I realized that they were doing surveillance on us and they were making it so that only one person could go at a time, making it so that it would flush automatically for each person, so that I don’t even know why they would have a reason to do this I guess they thought maybe somebody would either waste water or waste something _______________. But I was having her open the stall and then close it again so that it would seem like another person went in there so that I could go too, and they wouldn’t know we were both in there. As I describe this, I remembered what happened before this, what led up to this. I was dreaming that Mom and Dad were home and for some reason Mom and Iwere both sleeping in the bedroom downstairs. And Dad was supposed to come to the bed in a little while, but he was playing his computer game or something. And it was like 11:00 at night, but Mom said, “I’m hungry. I want to go eat something.” And so I suggested, “Well, we should go upstairs to my bed so that when Dad goes to bed in his bed and goes to sleep, we can get up without waking him up. Because if we stay here and he goes to sleep, when we get up, then he’ll wake up.” So we went up to my bed and then, I guess, before we knew it we were walking downtown to this restaurant. And it was someplace – I don’t remember where it was – oh, it was a Chinese place. And I had, we were all kind of sharing, but I had some kind of chicken, it was like fried sesame chicken, but it was, there was something else too. And there wasa plate of something else too, some kind of meat. And I was thinking, you know, “I should have vegetables, spinach and meat and ______.” And I thought “I usually have meat and a vegetable. And she said, “Oh well, it’s alright.” You don’t have to worry about that, you have vegetables in the freezer. I couldn’t really taste in this dream, but as I ate the fried chicken, I realized that there was some broccoli and some other kind of steamed vegetables in the sauce too. I can’t remember what the other dish was that I had. And I think, I don’t know, I thinkthe air port thing was separate, not part of the restaurant thing. And I think that’s all I can remember for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5080,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(603) Last night I was having a dream that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam had come to town, and I think it was Christmas time because we were going around looking at everybody’s lights. And they took us to this one house that I think was their house. It had a horse puppet that was really big, and it was like t_____ things and it was like a marionette puppet tied to the roof and it was automated so they were saying how they would have liked to give it some more moves, but it would have really cost them. I guess the people who put it up there charged an arm and a leg for the moves that it could do. And then I was upstairs with Mom and we were trying to vacuum and the vacuum cleaner was like bizarre. It was instead of being loud and normal, it was quiet and the motor was turning like extremely slow. And I thought, “Jeepers, what’s up with this?” And also in this dream my sink was dripping like crazy and I was beside myself because I didn’t know what to do about it and I’m very conscious about not wasting water. I always feel kind of beside myself when I notice that it’s dripping. I think that’s all there was to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5082,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(617) Last night I was having some crazy dreams. First I was dreaming that we were ___________ that was like ___________ but they had different names and neither one of them __________________, but they were real proud of me and ________________________ and they like __________________________. So _________________ _________________ on 7th Street. And I was kind of taking care of them. I think I was like – oh, what should I say? – I was ________ing up things around the house and I was helping to dress them or something. And they had an alarm, but somehow I was able to get in and out and just deal with it. They taught me how to shut it off. And the only thing was when I would leave, I wouldn’t re-arm it. I would let their next caregiver to come and she wasn’t __________________. And I really wanted to _____________________. I guess I really do miss the coming and going at ___________. The only time I was like afraid is when I was in the house and they weren’t there for some reason. But they showed me how to look at it and make sure that it was off. And ___________________ a house alarm security system, but the settings were all dealt with on a panel that looked like an alarm clock, like one of those ones you find in a hotel room. That was kind of odd. I kind of think there was a whole lot more to these people. It was kind of a nice dream actually. We were talking and stuff. But I don’t remember too much of it. Now the next one is kind of bizarre. We were at Disneyland, Mom and I, and it was one of those things where __________________________ and apparently Dad didn’t really go on any of the rides, but he was out in the middle of the park where there was grass and trees and stuff, and he was just kind of like bored to death, kind of sleeping in the truck. We had the green truck this time. Now there were some things that were leading up to this, but I can’t really remember _________. I just remember the really scary part. Mom and I were in the Bermuda Triangle ride, which it’s like in a big auditorium and the floor just kind of moves this way and that, kind of makes you think you have to go somewhere. And we were kind of walking around. There was a whole lot of people there. And we were playing musical chairs and picking different seats. And Mom, I was little enough so Mom could just carry me. I must have been like a toddler because she could carry me comfortably. And then they made a big announcement that everybody had to get out, and there was a fire alarm. And it didn’t actually sound like the fire alarm at school. It sounded like a very loud fire truck back-up alarm. So she was able to just grab me and scoop me up in her arms, and we were off. And there were just tons of ______ and tons of people trying to get out. I don’t know where all those people came from because I didn’t notice so many people when we were enjoying the show. And somehow they had people that were directing the traffic and we were able to get out. And when we got out __________, and I can remember just feeling really, really scared after that. And Mom was like, “I’m going to put you down, I’m going to put you down,” and then eventually she did, but I said, “I ____________ if I’m getting heavy, you can put me down, but I’m not letting go of you for anything.” And then the next little scene was that – oh, I know – we were out at the green truck and Dad was talking to somebody about it, and a lot of the hardware on the back near the bumper, like there was some p____ and things and there were a couple of other things that were for towing, and a lot of hardware was all made out of chocolate. So when you had a hankering for chocolate, you could just go to the back of the green truck and get some. And for some reason Mom and I were going up this tower because apparently we wanted to take the green truck up there for some crazy, crazy reason – I don’t know why – and it was kind of like Tuck’s Tunnel at Great Explorations, which I’ve never been there, except there was a light on and it was all white instead of all dark. It was like there was light and there was like white carpet on everything, so you were in a white nothingness. And we crawled and we crawled, and at first it was fine, and then Dad and I, we turned, we were going higher and higher, we were just crawling and crawling up the slope. And then we turned and it got like almost too tight to go any further. And I got kind of off ____________. And Dad said, “Well, you just have to go about it the right way,” and he got kind of a little stuck too and he had to kind of go out the other way. And we went the other way and there were like these doors that led – we thought they went out to some kind of stairs that go down to the outside, but they led to this observation deck, which was kind of, there were tables and there were _____ and there was this wrought iron railing and stuff. And we asked somebody ___________ the stairs back ____________. And I was kind of afraid to go down the stairs because of what happened at the other place. I’m trying to think, did I ever come down? I don’t think so. I think I was on the observation deck and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5083,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(640) Last night I was having a dream that I was riding on a big ship with some older ladies. I felt like they were people I knew, but I wasn’t really sure who they were. And we were going someplace. I had a feeling that they didn’t like to fly, so we were traveling by boat instead of by air. And I was inviting them to come and see me at home sometime. And they said, “Oh no, I couldn’t really do that because my car would need to be washed,” or something goofy like that. And then the next scene was that I was in the back yard and we had a pet goat. And we had six or seven baby chicks. It was a pretty nice dream. I dreamt that I had four yellow chicks. There were two that were kind of golden, like they’d grow up to be Golden Comets. And there was one with dark feathers, and I wasn’t sure if it was a Rhode Island Red or a black chicken. But I was worried that the goat would eat them, and I was doing all kinds of things to try and keep them apart. I was out behind the garage in the alley and trying to feed the goat grass, and then the goat laid down and I laid down and I was kind of picking up handfuls of grass and dropping it over where the goat’s head was. And I realized the goat was asleep. And then next thing I knew, the goat was laying down inside the fence by the back gate, and the chickies were walking and climbing over him, and I was trying to move them and get them away from him real fast. But then I noticed he was just laying there as they were climbing over him, and I realized that goats don’t eat meat, that goats are herbivores, I think.

I dreamt that it was Easter time, of all things, and I had gotten Mom and Dad a keyboard so that they could learn to play the piano if they wanted. And apparently I think they must have wanted to. It was kind of like the first one I had, like the cheap Radio Shack model. It wasn’t really that big. So I had wrapped it up and put it on a stand so it was kind of pretty obvious what it was. And we were doing the usual Easter basket thing, and Mom had put some little things in my Easter basket. I had a feeling like they were like note pads and little diddley things like that. And we were going to do Easter things on Easter morning. And I don’t remember what happened or why, but Mom and Dad had some kind of argument and Dad decided, “Well, I don’t want to do any Easter things now. In fact, I don’t want to do any Easter things this week.” So I figured, “Well, okay, that figures. I’m going to open my Easter basket all by myself, and I’m going to take everybody’s presents back upstairs, and I might not even keep them; I’ll just get rid of them.” And then I can’t really remember opening my Easter basket, and then I’m trying to remember what else there was. I was in the kitchen and Mom and Dad were on the back steps. And Mom and Dad were trying to talk about making a schedule and holding _______ mark again, and Dad like, there was a bush of sort of like daisies, I think, and Dad whipped his hand across the bush and was on purpose like knocking all the blooms off of the bush and starting to yell. And I think I, I opened the door and said, “Hey, everybody, you have to stop this. This isn’t civil. What are you doing here? You’re wrecking things.” And somehow Dad slid and fell backwards and pushed me backwards too, and I was laying on the floor and his torso was laying on top of me, and not really on purpose, we just sort of fell and that’s how it happened. And I felt like I was being crushed, and I said, “Get up, get up; I can hardly breathe. I can’t move.” And he said, “Well, you’ll just have to get yourself up.” And so I twisted and fought and pushed and fought my way out from under him, and eventually I was able to get free and get up, and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5085,,,,,,,,"(594) Last night I was having a dream that we were supposed to be together with family or something, like Sheryl, Sandra and Sam, and that we were going to go to some theme park, but somehow in all of this we were riding in the car at nighttime and it’s like when we used to bring Sheryl and Sandra and Sam home from North Dakota, Jacksonville. And they were in the back and I was laying across Mom and Dad’s laps in the front. And the next little scene was that somehow I was all grown up and I was supposed to, I was scheming and planning a way to buy two tickets to a theme park and save it. I had won them or something. And I thought I was going to buy two tickets to Venture Island, but as it turned out, I realized that I wouldn’t really want to go there because a lot of the water things that were there have these vents and jets and all the scary things in them. So I decided in this dream some strange lady gave me like a program of concerts going on at Universal Studios. And in this dream I decided that I was going to go there instead because of all the concerts and everything. And I had come up with this plan thinking that Mom and I would be able to go go by ourselves and ditch Dad so we wouldn’t have to listen to him complaining about everything anyway. And I was looking over this program and it said that Bett Midler and Barbara Streisand and other people were going to be there, and I was trying to make my plan. The hardest part was deciding which day to go and who to see. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5086,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(630) I have been having a problem __________________, a problem which I have never really had and I only really _______________________. But basically when I got my cleaning and my xrays from the college back in May, they had given me a referral to go to my dentist because they said that it looked like one of my fillings on the lower right was wearing out. Now wearing out, that doesn’t really sound like it’s a cavity or anything. So I said, “Well, I’ll just let it go; I don’t want to go deal with that.” So now it’s the end of August and in the past few days it has really been getting my attention, and I’ve been finding all kinds of ways to deal with it, like tipping my head sideways or having Listerine in my mouth for a while has done a pretty good job of numbing it for about an hour, not really numbing it, but making the pain going away. And ibuprofen doesn’t really work that well, but I dug through the cabinet and I found _______________ does work, and I took it before Carl came and it worked like a charm all evening long. So I’m telling you all of this because last night I had a dream about teeth. And I mean, that would stand to reason, right? There was something else going on, and I have really no clue what it was, which is unfortunate. I woke up in a “blahhhhhh” state of mind because in order to go to sleep with all those issues, I had to take a pill, which really made me feel like a dead fish in the morning. So I couldn’t remember most of what I dreamt, but what I did remember was that I had lost several teeth. I mean, they just started getting looser and fell out, just like they did when I was little. And then the one on the right, which was bothering me, in my dream it finally came loose and fell out too, but what it was, was instead of a normal-sized tooth, it was a huge oval chunk thing, and I said, “Well, how in the world could this be in my mouth?” And as I held it and studied it and examined it, it got bigger and bigger and bigger, and it was like it’s the weirdest thing. I mean, it was an old, old thing. It was almost like a picture frame and the outside perimeter was a little bit more raised than the middle, and the middle was sort of indented and kind of lumpy and bumpy, and it was kind of like one of the big molars in the back, I guess. But I looked it in the _______ and it had like all these colorful sparkly things in it, and it just sort of crumbled and it was falling apart in my hand and there was gooky stuff and it was the grossest thing ever, and it was kind of funny. And one thing ______________ because I was having a funny little memory of when I was about 10 and Sheryl came in 1995 and _______________ for some reason kind of ___________ at the time. And I guess I was losing teeth or something, and Sheryl said, “Oh, I know, you’re going to have a dream tonight that the tooth fairy is going to bring you an amplifier in the shape of a tooth, and it’s going to blow you out of your bedroom.” That was funny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually _________________________. Before that I was _________ with Mrs. Lotts, and she was teaching a lesson at Terri’s house. And it was dark and it was dingy. Actually, wait. Before that, See, when you think about things remember more of it. I was playing the piano for Mrs. Lotts’s choir and we were in a school room. And I was playing these simple little songs like “Hark the Herald Angels Sing” and different little carols and __________________ __________. And I was playing them all in the key of D, and I probably shouldn’t have done that. But I guess the ones that are in penta chord form I should play in D because that’s the range for a young child’s voice; it sets the best in their head voice. And in my dream pretty much all these songs were in penta chord form, so I guess that’s why I played them all in D. And I was just sort of [tape goes blank]. For most of them I was able to fudge my way through in accompaniment style, and then I said we were in a classroom while we were doing this. She had this Irish song that was a more complicated arrangement, and it had a recorder solo. And she had a little organ in the music room. It was like the one I practiced on at the college. It was a little, little bitty, bitty, bitty pipe organ with a free-standing case. But she made it play really loud with mixtures and a full chorus and everything and a recorder solo was heard above it. I don’t remember which song it was, but it was something. And that little children’s choir was able to sing out above that loud organ. And then next thing I know, she and I and her kids were at Terri’s house with some bizarre reason. And I don’t even remember what we were doing. I think it was some kind of a lesson, but I don’t remember what it was. And then there was this book, and it had this story that like went on forever, and it was all supposed to be sung. And I was just flipping through it and reading the words and glancing up at the staff every now and then to kind of see what the melody was doing. And I couldn’t really understand it. It was like chant or shape notes or something wacko like that. And I was thinking to myself, “I hope Terri’s alarm doesn’t work any more and I hope she ____________ whatever.” Because Terri wasn’t home and we were just like crashing in her house _________. And there was something more to this, but I can’t remember what we were doing. I don’t know. Then suddenly I was walking to Safeway, and I was roaming around, I had all these bags like Mom brings and I was trying to look for groceries. But I couldn’t find anything. I wandered through this part of the store that had a wood floor _____ table, and some people were having like a banquet there, you know like those catered things sometimes. And I was hungry; I wanted some. But I wasn’t invited, so I couldn’t barge in. And I was wandering around and wandering around and looking and looking, and I was able to find a few things, but it was not really near what I had come for. And then I went out to the parking lot because I thought somebody was going to drive me home. Somebody had talked to me at one time that they were going to drive me home. And this Grandpa truck was in the parking lot and I had the keys and I opened up the door, and I turned the ignition to run position so that the accessories would run, and there was some jazz, 98.7 on the radio. And I loaded up the one or two bags of groceries that I had and I was sitting there listening for like a half an hour. And nobody showed up to drive me home. And this time in this dream, I didn’t even want to drive. And so I turned off the ignition and locked it with the key, like it was a car. And I locked up the door and I took my groceries, and this time when I got out of the truck, I not only had my two bags of groceries, I had like bazillions of water jug bags, just like Mom has. They were all empty. And I was going back in the door, and I came in like a back door, and I was standing there like blah. And some lady said, “Oh, I’ll take those for you because I’m going to go and get water myself.” And I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, I realized, “Well, gee, what are we going to use when we go to get water next time?” And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5089,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(613) Last night I had quite a dream that I was at a school that was kind of like my high school, but I felt like it was a college. It was during the summer and the type of activities that were going on were like a college orientation, but there were young kids there and I was kind of a young kid. And I think there were kind of middle teenagers, like 15 and 16 years old, and most of them were girls. And I think Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there too. And we were on this playground. And it was a big, huge, tall playground with equipment for teenagers, like monkey bars that were really, really, really tall and stuff like that. And I was kind of involved in some kind of a hazing thing, I guess it was, now that I look back on it, in order to get into this whatever I was trying to get into. This group of girls was going to do something really odd. They would throw me up in the air and I would throw around and throw around and throw around and I would come down and I would hit this mat. And when I would come down and hit the mat, there was going to be this terrible, terrible, awful, awful, really really loud sound that would be triggered. And so I think I had________ or something, and I did – I swirled all around and when I came down, it was just sort of like I floated to the ground and nothing happened. And the sound thing didn’t work, fortunately. And I can remember doing a monkey bar thing and hoping that I wouldn’t fall. And I was climbing to the top of some of this really, really tall teenage equipment. And somebody pushed me off of one of the things, and again, I kind of flew threw the ground and that time when I hit the mat, nothing happened either. But then they were kind of starting to chase after me, and Mom was there, and by that time it was almost dusk. And we were like running to the car because they were chasing after me, and when Mom and I got in the car, the car wouldn’t start, but she just kind of put it in neutral and was able to get it going and kind of steer it a little bit. And we kind of were bumbling our way off into the night, and before I knew it we were home. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5090,,,,,,,05-13-2010,"(568) Last night I had a dream that we were in my relative’s home town with Aunt Christine, and there were some strangers there. Maybe it was Uncle Bob & Bobby. I don’t see them that much, so maybe they were the strangers. But at first I was like sitting in a living room, but it didn’t really look like their living room. It looked kind of more like Elizabeth’s living room. And they had a really nice sound system. They put it on, and I was listening to something while I was drawing or writing. I was bored, trying to use up the time, you know. And I don’t know what Mom and Dad were doing. They were out shopping or some activity like that. And there was something to do with the kitchen, I don’t remember what. Somebody was either painting the kitchen or cooking in the kitchen or doing something. And then I got tired and I think I went to bed, but I’m not sure. Maybe I just slept on the couch. And the next day Mom was saying something about wanting to do something with Aunt Christine’s mirror because in this dream when you would go into the bathroom, it would be these three mirrors all tilted in toward each other like a bay window. One mirror was nice and a little fancy, like a little bit of ____________. The middle mirror was like really, really, really fancy. And the mirror to the right was like falling apart and real plain, so Mom decided she wanted to make the right mirror a little fancy to go with the one on the left. So she said, “Do you want to stay with me and work on the mirror, or do you want to walk?” and I wanted to walk and I said in this dream, something about how I did all the scribbling I could possibly do yesterday. And so we walked a little, and we came to this park and they were having like this fair and we were walking around these different booths ___________________________________. ______________________ _________________________. And then ________________________ kind of looked like our park. And I could hear the band, and I was running up the hill to get closer to the band ___________________. And there were some ducks along the way and I was stopping to look at the ducks. I couldn’t really get close to them. . Then I woke up. And actually before all of this, ______________________________. And so of course Aiden was bouncing off the walls when it was time to go. I didn’t want him running around tearing stuff up. And so I was on the porch and I was swinging on the swing and playing a little game with him. And then I was able to pick him up and carry him like a baby, right out the front door to his parents. So after the Christineery thing, I woke up and I went to the bathroom, and I really didn’t intend to go back to sleep, but I did and I slept til 8:30 again. And when I went back to sleep I had another kind of crazy dream about being in my relative’s home town. I couldn’t figure out if I was in my relative’s home town or I was in a class. Believe it or not. We were doing this Jeopardy game and it was really like awful stuff. I wanted to go with some other students to go have my picture taken by the kindergarten pod at South Bend. I felt like we were there. But yet we were in this classroom doing this jeopardy game__________ and I don’t remember what it was about. I think it was something about geography. And then the next thing I knew I was like down in Aunt Christine’s basement by the washing machine, and I had a desk and a computer and I was entering _________________. And I was thinking to myself how I really, I didn’t want to be down there, but I could fool myself into thinking I was just in a room and not in a basement, which is kind of how I would think when I would sneak down there. And I was hearing this story. Somebody was talking and telling me this story about an organist who played a morning service, an afternoon service and an evening service. He had like three services in a day, and he had to play them all at this organ that was in this basement. He had to come down there and ________ off in the sanctuary. That was really bizarre. And I was thinking how really I wouldn’t want to be down there for that long. I guess that came from one day I was joking around about the hot water heater in our cellar, and I was saying how, you know, the ducts for the heater, “Oh, these could be organ pipes and the console could be right down here.” And then I thought ______________, “I wouldn’t want to play down here.” And Mom said, “Well, no you wouldn’t, especially if somebody shut off the light and closed the door.” And that’s all there is to that mixed up/ mashed up mess. I probably used up more tape than I should have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5096,,,,,,,,"(609) Last night I had a funny dream that I was at St. Paul’s for Easter. Now for some reason in this dream the sanctuary was this great big round rotunda with a wooden floor and big windows and curtains; no stained glass windows, just plain old, big old windows. And instead of pews, we were all sitting in chairs, kind of in rows. And the organ loft is up in the back and there was like a stage almost instead of an altar, kind of like one of these mega churches would be. The AGO calls them Big Box Churches, I guess. And I was there with somebody with dark hair. I kind of half thought it might be Marylou, but I kind of thought it was Sandra. And I was kind of thinking maybe it was Sheryl, even though Sheryl has light hair in real life. I kind of feel like it must have been Sheryl because I had a feeling it wasn’t somebody really religious, but was just kind of there. And I was just kind of observing, and I was listening to the organ, and I was hearing the organ playing really loud and I wasn’t hearing people sing too much because people don’t really sing that much, I guess. And I was hearing the priest go on and on, and they were doing their different readings and things, and then everybody was going up to the stage/altar all in a big line. I think that there were lots of children who were getting baptized or first communion or something, but they were all in colorful outfits. They weren’t wearing white. And then the priest was giving a sermon. I don’t even remember any words. It was just like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he had a lot of the mannerisms of Pastor Mike and he was all in white. And then the organ played again and I kind of turned around when the organ was playing, and I looked up there and I could see some pipes. And the organ, we were singing “Rock of Ages,” and just like when I sing in church for real, I could feel my voice more than I could hear it. And so I could feel my voice resonating, and I was singing my heart out because I was so glad they picked one that I know the words to. And for real I really am happy when I finally hear a tune that I know the words to because, as much as I have been in church the past year, I still don’t know many of the words to the hymns because people don’t enunciate very well when they sing, and I don’t take the time to stay; I want to go home. So in my dream I was, they didn’t even have a post ______. The just did the last hymn and then everybody got up and for some reason I was wearing a vestment, like for a choir. I was singing like out in the congregation, but I was wearing a vestment. And when I got up, I not only lost the bottom of my vestment, but I lost my pants too. Then I was running around with no pants and a bare butt, and everybody was like, “Oh my God, oh, my God!” And this one lady who was like an elder there, like one of the ladies like Judy from Christ Lutheran, she was like, “Oh, Honey, you can come with me.” I was kind of running around like a chicken without my head because I didn’t know what to do. I felt like people were going to like nab me and kick me out or something and I didn’t know which way to run. But this lady was like, “Oh, Honey, you can come with me.” And she took me to this back room and she gave me this purple ticket that would allow me to go into the donation closet and pick a pair of clothes, or at least a pair of pants or something. And so I picked these purple shorts with sparkly jewels on them, and I put them on, and then I woke up. That was crazy, wasn’t it? But actually, to think about it, I think this might be because I might not be buying everything they say all the time, I don’t take everything so literally as they do, and sometimes I have my own ideas and I wonder how it might be if they ever found out what was really in my heart. This running around with no pants thing is probably about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5097,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(638) I overslept again today. Last night I was having a dream. I don’t remember if I was at St. Bartholomew’s or St. Thomas, but I was at one of those churches. And it was kind of small and local and Episcopalian, I know that much, and I was in there to take some pictures and then possibly play the organ. And the doors were unlocked and I felt like I could just walk in because I know that neither one of them really, I don’t think either of them has anything to be afraid of like Christ Lutheran does. So I was in there and I was sort of having feelings like, “Gee, what if somebody catches me in here; what would they think?” And before I could take a picture – I wanted to take one of those pictures where it’s kind of a crazy illusion where you’re standing there and you’re looking up and you see all the stained glass windows and everything. But somebody came in and said, “You know you really shouldn’t be in here, so I had to leave, but then two other people were coming in behind her, and before I knew it, all of Dr. Keyes class was in there to rehearse. And I think even Astrid was there, because she’s in college chorus now. And in that part of the dream there weren’t any pews or anything. There was this great big wide open space where they were standing and rehearsing. And, in fact, when Dr. Toronto’s chorus was assembling, the scene kind of shifted and they were in the cafeteria. And we were like in a school cafeteria, like either at Bancroft or at my elementary school. It wasn’t like my high school’s cafeteria. And I’m trying to think, I think some people were sitting and some people were standing, but they were basically in formation. And I walked in the door and I asked Dr. Toronto, “Is it okay if I just listen today?” And he said, “Why sure.” So – get this – I put a pallet and a blanket down and some pillows and I laid down and I listened to them rehearse laying down, as if I were going to a sleepover. What is up with that? And there were some times during the rehearsal when somebody was just goofing around or they’re doing what they were supposed to or something, and he just sort of went over and talked to them quietly and then they left. And I heard people make comments about that. And so there was kind of an uproar, I mean a moderate uproar in rehearsal. I have no memory of what they were singing or how they were doing it. There was kind of a little episode there because Dr. T. said we were going to have to cut it short because they were going to do a fire drill and we were going to have to go outside. And as long as we were going to be interrupted, we may as well go outside because it was going to happen like any second now. So all these like 40 or 50 choristers were going out ahead of me, and I thought, “Gee, how am I going to get out in time?” And, as a matter of fact, I got outside before it happened and I never heard it in this dream. And I started walking away from the school, like so that I would be further away when it happens. And Dr. T. started walking with me, and we were walking down the little path that was kind of off school grounds, if you will. And, again, I’m not even sure what school I was at in this dream. So while we were walking, he was talking to me and encouraging me, “You know, you should start singing again.” And I was thinking, “Well, I don’t know. I don’t think I can.” And he had me match some notes and I could match them, and he said, “See there?” He was talking about hymns and how easy it is to learn to sing hymns. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5098,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(563) I had some kind of __________ dreams last night. The first one was that Mom and Dad and I were taking one of our long road trips, and it wasn’t too long because it was in our state, but up to a faraway city I consider that long. But where my dream started was that we were in this big bed and breakfast type place. It was kind of sort of like a hotel, just in that it was a place for people can stay. But it had big roomy rooms with nice, homey furniture like a bed and breakfast. And our whole family was staying there. There was Mom and Dad and I and there was, I had the feeling that Carl was there and Arlene and we were all gathering there to see Aunt Janice for some kind of special occasion that she was having. And this is like a stop-off point for us before we actually meet up with her. And in this dream it was kind of nice because I had my own huge room. It was almost like a suite. I had a big bedroom, a private bathroom, and I could shut the door, and it was totally separate from Mom and Dad’s space because usually whenever we go on a trip, or we go to somebody’s house and we end up staying, I have to be in the same room with Mom and Dad, and, you know, I don’t have any real issues or anything when it’s just kind of strange sleeping with both of them because, you know, I feel like I can’t move, I can’t do anything without being noticed. And here I felt really comfortable because I was in my own room, I was folding my clothes and I was putting them at the foot of my bed, and I had the radio on and I was brushing my hair and I was generally getting myself together. And I think I just gotten out of the shower and I was naked, and I had to go and find Mom and Dad’s room because Mom had my really pretty dress that I was going to wear. And so I opened the door and I’m in this huge foyer landing and I’m totally naked, and I think I know which is Mom and Dad’s room. And I open the door, and it’s not. It’s the men’s exercise, weight-lifting room. But fortunately, there was no one in there at this time. And then I opened another door that was Mom and Dad’s room, and Mom was doing something to my dress, like sewing it or something. And so I had to sit a few minutes to kind of wait for her to finish. And I felt a little bit funny, like maybe something was the matter. You know how some of the little tips turn into big things and some of them are just little things. Well, I felt like one of the little things was going on and I wanted to get back to my room, but I needed my dress. And eventually Mom gave me my dress and I kind of put it on in there so I wouldn’t have to walk naked through the foyer again. And then I went back to my room and fiddled around a little bit more. I think I had the radio on again, I was folding clothes again and doing something, packing a bag or something. And then I wanted to see if there was a big TV like on an armoire type of thing. And it must have been on mute, but it was blasting pictures at me, and I couldn’t figure out what it was. But I figured, “Well, I should find a way to turn this off. What is this doing on? I’m not going to watch it. We’re getting ready to go somewhere.” And so I felt around across the top and down the side and I couldn’t really find any way to turn it off. So I said, “Oh well, it’s not really hurting anything. I guess I’ll just leave it on.” And then the craziest part of all . Some lady or girl or somebody that I kind of thought I knew was laying in my bed with a bunny rabbit, a real live bunny rabbit, just sort of cradling it in her arms. And I was petting it and I thought it was the sweetest thing ever. And I was thinking, “Oh how nice – she has a pet bunny.” And I don’t’ remember much more about that. I remember when we were petting the bunny, we were just kind of hanging out waiting to go off. And then I woke up and kind of rolled around a little bit. It was daylight, but I went back to sleep. And during the 7:00 o’clock hour I had a dream that kind of felt weird, like maybe it was a non-REM dream or something. It was just kind of boring and nothing to it. I dreamt that I lived in Penelope’s complex, but it wasn’t like the real Westminster Palms. In my dream there was a very barren-like gray walls and gray like squarish hallways. It was almost like a prison or something. And it kind of put me to mind of _________’s kind of world, in the hallways that are in it. And I just think, “Oh, who would want to live here?” And so I was in a room right next door to Penelope and I was going to my tech school at the same time. Talk about mixed up! And I don’t even remember what I was doing. I just remember feeling kind of alone and like I had no place to really go and do anything with anybody. And I was just kind of stuck there, like almost in a prison. And then",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5099,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(570) I had a couple dreams last night. Let’s see, first I was doing something at school. And I don’t know what it was, but I was with a group of other students, like some of the ones from the organ group and we were going into a place that was like the Bancroft gym and they said that there was going to be a Celine Dion concert, and that they were going to take pictures and do a sound check and everything, and they were going to let us in ahead of time. And so I was with Lana Tripp and she took me right down in front, and we were sitting and waiting for the concert to start. This gym had a dome, like the ________ dome, and it was all blue. And then when the concert started, they would project different images on it and stuff. And it seemed like they were taking forever to get things together. And I really didn’t hear anything at the sound test, I didn’t see any behind-the-scenes things. There were two or three clowns dancing around and acting crazy, and a person behind the stage doing the sound test. It was really just other people doing really boring stuff, like a typical sound test would be. And so I was talking to Lana Tripp but I was digging in my purse and I was getting my new monocular and I was starting my recorder, and I was trying to use my cell phone to call home to tell Mom where I was and what I was doing. I felt like we were close to home, and I had to meet up with her later that night to do something. And every time, I found out the hard way why they tell you not to use cell phones because when I would use my cell phone and talk, the sound would somehow weaken the PA so you couldn’t hear it like in the concert hall, so like everybody could hear what I was saying. I was so embarrassed. But then the concert was about to start and everybody was parading around on the first song It was like a Prince song. I couldn’t hardly hear that well, even though we were right down front. And she was wearing that metal like top that you see in the Taking Chances tour video. And then I woke up and I was like, I moved on, I didn’t wake up, but I moved on to the next scene. I needed to connect with Mom because I was having an organ recital that evening at the Palladium. It was going to be, I thought it was going to be just me for a whole hour, but as it turned out, it was me and this other boy that I met on our trip that was going to do the finale. And I was thinking to myself, “Do I know enough repertoire to fill up a half an hour?” And are my silly, diddly little corral preludes going to be enough to satisfy them, or are they going to want big honking, loud and like Widor stuff? And I didn’t even know the organ, and it was like the night of the show. And Mom took me there, and we got there like about 7:00 and I was supposed to play at 8:00. And _________. There was a bedroom in there for artists to stay in. It was like a hotel room that was backstage. And there was this, I don’t know why, but I was laying down in this bed, waiting for somebody to roll the organ out. And I was laying in bed and there was like a pedal board attached to the foot board and I was trying to practice one of my pieces with my hands in the air. And I was like, “This is like so not working!” And then I was going up the stage to the organ to get settled, and I was thinking, “God, I have like no time to like a) practice my piece to get the feel of the action and b) settle my stops and my pistons and everything.” And I didn’t even know if we were allowed to set pistons. And I just put on something that sounded kind of cheesey like an 8 foot and a 2 foot flute stop, and then just a regular diapason 8 foot on the Great. And I was practicing, it wasn’t really anything actually that I know, it was just something. And then this other boy came up, and it was like 7:30 by that time and it was time for him to play his piece. And I was really worried about how it was going to go, but I just figured what the heck. I mean, I’m just gona’ have to wing it. And then he seemed kind of nice, like he’s going to help me set the pistons. And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5100,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalc:jasmine details,05-13-2010,"(631) Last night I was having a long string of really weird dream sequences. My voice is pretty low right now and it should stay like that. Okay, first of all I dreamt that I was in my relative’s home town and I was with Grammy, and I don’t know if Mom was there or not, but I was sleeping in a bed and it was morning time and she was vacuuming and she just opened my door and brought this vacuum cleaner in and it was so loud, and, of course, I didn’t like the fact that she woke me up. So I tried to say something, but my voice couldn’t be heard above the sound, so I got up and I was like waving her back with my hand and by the time she moved on to the next room, I wanted to make my point. So I hurried up and ran in the next room and was trying to show with my body how frustrated I was. And then the next thing was, there was a school that apparently – I’m trying to think of the word – I think it was called Writers L_____ University. And it wasn’t a regular university, but it also had this other wing that was for young people, and it was kind of like Interlochen (?) in that it was for really talented arts people. And I don’t know how I got there. I wasn’t actually enrolled, but I was walking in the ________ and _____________ walk into some of the classrooms, and in one of them they were doing like animated projects and things. And this one girl had rigged a piano, like a prepared piano, except it was with electronic sampling, and she had this box full of CD’s and she said they would allow her to play her favorite ‘90’s songs. And the one she demonstrated for us was “Paints” (?) ______________ grown up in our family portrait we were pretty happy, let’s go back to that. So the CD played like the background accompaniment and then she played the foreground sound, like on a regular like keyboard patch. And everybody was kind of like, “Oh, I ____________, this isn’t really anything very beautiful. Anybody could do that.” And there some other things; I can’t remember exactly what they were. But I think for some reason there was a fire drill, I think. I don’t really remember it that well. I don’t remember rushing to leave the building. I just remember feeling pretty lost when I came back in. And everybody was kind of thinking that I was not following the right procedures. I don’t go in the right line or I didn’t do the right check-in or I didn’t make the right handshake or something, and I felt like, I kind of felt like I was sort of pseudo enrolled ______ first day, and I was like, “Well, I wish I would have known what the correct procedure to follow was.” And so apparently you had this paper that you overlaid over a calendar and you to cut out a little opening over the dates where this happened so that you could show that you were there for that day. I don’t know of anything crazier. And then next the really bad part was that – oh, and before I go to that, in this school one time I was walking down the hall and Garrison K_______ was there reading one of his books and giving a lecture, and he was out in the hall and there were several students around him. So I went to go and listen to him for a while and then I kind of faded away after a while. Then I dreamt that I think I was in my relative’s home town or something, and something really awful had happened to me and I was laying there with Mom kind of trying to discuss it. And I didn’t remember it actually happening, but I remember kind of feeling intuitively like it did happen. And I was saying to Mom, “Well, if it was real, then why don’t I remember it?” And she was saying, “Well, if it was so horrible you repressed it.” And she was saying, “We need to get you to a doctor and get you checked out” and stuff like that. I was feeling kind of really funny about the whole thing, and I was crying in the dream, but there were no tears per se. And it took me a long time to just get kind of calmed down and all that sort of thing. I don’t know where in the world such a bizarre thing could have come from. And I’m trying to think if that was the last thing that happened before I woke up, because when I woke up, I was so relieved that none of it was real. And there was one other thing that happened along the way. I was in the church and I was diddling around playing their organ and their choir was kind of warming up, and I thought that I could just sort of hang around, and then – oh, and I was looking at a picture that was hanging from the music desk where they had tied it on. And was like a picture of a saint or somebody, but I couldn’t figure out who it was. And then somebody leaned over and said, “Hey, we’re about to start. This isn’t polite to be doing this when we’re about to start.” And I said, “Well, okay, I’ll ______ your instrument and leave.” And that’s all I can remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the yard below, the army marches prisoners around, and makes up games to kill them. I have to keep my_eldest_daughter away from the windows. There is one particularly brutal incident which I witness from the bathroom window. The soldiers have carried a prisoner up about 6 stories of a fire escape. He looks perhaps middle-eastern. There's a crowd of soldiers below cheering as two soldiers up the fire escape dangle the prisoner upside down by his ankles over the edge. His hands and legs are tied and he is blindfolded. They then drop him head first onto the concrete ground below. He lands like a sack of potatoes with a crack. The soldiers cheer. Then, the main soldier up the fire escape jumps off in a different direction, and lands on a large inflated mattress - the sort used in stunts. But doesn't land on it properly - he sort of hits the edge of it and then hits the ground. It looks as if he breaks his neck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's incredibly dangerous - I almost get run down by a huge yacht that almost squashes me against the side of the canal. I get out of the water and meet a girl who has had more success taking photos in the water than me.

Placed in front of each person (on the desks) is a shallow tank of clear water. At the bottom of the water in each tank (which is about two inches deep) is a waterproof piece of paper. The game is played by one person hitting a ping pong ball around the room with a table tennis bat. When the ball arrives near another player, they have to hit it up and away to keep the game going. When the ball is elsewhere in the room, players have to draw on the paper under the water. There's also the notion that you have to attempt to hit the ball so hard that it passes through the two inches of water in someone's tank, and bounces off the bottom, and back up through the water.

5131,,,,,,ID: lawrence_journal_2011:lawrence details,01-04-2009,"This dream was epic, like a feature film in length, conjuring up a completely new world. As in many dreams, there seems to be multiple strands to the plot which aren't consistent with each other. Firstly I was at university - but it was unlike any I've been to before. The campus appears to be built inside the ruins of an ancient Greek or Roman city. I say ruins, however some of the buildings were still quite complete, like the student halls of residence for example. These halls were inside a huge circular building that was lined on the edge with a series of columns and a balcony or walkway that appeared to have little protection from the elements. There was also a huge drop to the ground to one side of the walkway, with only a stone balustrade for protection. This building was next to the sea and the waves were angrily crashing against the foot of the building several stories below. The building was of marble or some other stone and had been originally carved intricately, but the weather (and perhaps the sea) had eroded all the details and edges away, so it was ridged and knobbly but smooth. The stone was a honey color, very hard and matte like honey colored granite, but from a distance it had a soft luminescence a bit like porcelain. Inside the building, the actual student accommodation was a more modern re-fit done on the cheap. Partitions of undecorated ply wood and plaster board had been fixed up to divide the space into smaller compartments. It almost felt like a squat. In another strand to the plot, this building is where my_friend Toby and his friend have their design studio. His friend is quite arrogant and appears to be the one in control. I seem to be joining their team at the point where they are about to present their new 'fantastic idea' to their new client. It appears to be an industrial design idea, and it is this: applying a thin layer of silver paint to things, thus creating the look of silver but at a low cost. I try to point out that the practice of doing this is already widespread and that this is no idea at all. But they are stubborn and ignore me. So we all go to the student shop to pick up some silver spray paint. The student shop is huge, like a mall, but full of stalls inside, like a market. It is apparently run by students. Some of the stalls are actually very expensively made glass cases set into mahogany dressers - like something you'd see in a Victorian jewellery shop. One girl is selling silverware. I ask her for an 18th century dagger. Amazingly she has one, but it's too small I say. She's dressed in an almost gothic way, but more theatrical, perhaps like a Victorian vampire. This place is bustling with students. The mall appears to be constructed sunk into the ground. The entrance is from above, as if descending down into an underground tube, except the whole thing is open. There seems to be only two very narrow sets of steps leading down and both are completely clogged up with people. There's a large plastic tube - perhaps it has something to do with construction (like the tubes you sometimes see going from the upper floors of a building to a skip). It is large enough to slide down, so that's how we get down, to avoid joining the long queue on the steps. Other stuff happened in this dream, but I can't recall the details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5132,,,,,,ID: lawrence_journal_2011:lawrence details,01-04-2009,"I'm in a bar in a small town near the town where I live. I'm having a beer at a long wooden table. The decor is old fashioned in there - it could be the 16th century. Even some of the other people look like they could be from that era. There are two long-haired students sitting at the other end of the table with beers. They are glum and are cynically eyeing me. I'm tetchy, and I snap and suddenly say something sarcastic. When they respond, their faces change, softening. This makes me feel immediately guilty for being so aggressive. They didn't hear what I said apparently, and are politely asking me to repeat it. They have accents I recognise: ""You're German aren't you?"" I say. ""Yes"" one of them replies. I change my stance, and attempt to be friendly. I ask them what part of Germany they're from and what they're doing in this country. They are students here apparently. I ask why they chose to study in such a small town, and not somewhere more exciting like a city. They regret coming here apparently. They took bad advice from someone they knew. However this town isn't all bad I tell them. ""Have you been to the mill cellar? The waterworks?"" They haven't. I tell them about the cellar - which is a huge medieval vault which contains an enormous water-powered machine - like a watermill but underground - perhaps powered by an underground river. I tell them there is a hotel above it, which is also medieval. Later I'm with my_partner - we have booked a room in that very hotel. While she is in the bathroom, I inspect the bedroom. It's large with stone walls, and polished floorboards. There's a four-poster bed. I notice a fairly big spider on the bed, and brush it off onto the floor. I instinctively go to stamp on it, but I stop myself, remembering that spiders are useful creatures. As I turn away, I notice another one - this one is enormous - it looks like a tarantula - black and shiny. My skin crawls. I'm afraid of it and back away. I call out to my_partner. I quickly glance around the room looking for a container like a bowl to catch it in. Then I notice a scorpion, tail in the air, advancing across the floor towards me. ""Jesus Christ!"" I shout to my_partner again ""There's a fucking scorpion! We've got to get out of this place!"" I then get the feeling that there are more of these creatures hidden somewhere. I wake up. It was a very vivid dream. I go into the bathroom, and while I'm brushing my teeth, I look down and you'll never guess what - a small sider is crawling down my upper arm. I brush it off quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5133,,,,,,ID: lawrence_journal_2011:lawrence details,01-04-2009,"I was in an institution - perhaps a prison or a prison camp. The prison incorporates several buildings and some fenced off land. The buildings were old. The interior decor seemed decades old, with formica fitted furniture, brown and split. In the dormitories there were bunk beds, acrylic curtains and cheap carpet tiles. There was a damp smell. I was living with a group of non-violent captives. We lived in unity - we seemed to get along. There was a communal area like a living room or common room with old sofas, a fire place, cheap ornaments and trinkets on the mantel piece. Across the yard (which was a muddy field) was another building that contained the more violent prisoners. It was a much more sturdy building made of brick and iron, and was surrounded by a security fence. Suddenly the door to our common room opened, and three men walked in, not in any rush. They had faces like psychopaths. The largest bearded one calmly started helping himself to things on the mantel piece and shelves around the room in front of perhaps 15 of us. He made confrontational eye contact with myself and anyone else who dared to look at him. His two sidekicks stood back and smirked at our inaction. None of us dared to confront them. They eventually turned and left, slamming the door, smirking. It reminded me of Clockwork Orange (the film). This incident broke the unity of our collective. We were all angry with one another that no one did anything to stop those thugs. The rest of the dream is fragmented: The thugs apparently came from the other building. We launched a retaliation which involved walking over there on mass ready for a confrontation. I think we were humiliated a second time - we were surrounded by murderers and psychopaths who wanted to have an excuse to kill us with their bare hands. There was also a scene back in our dorms with arguments breaking out about ownership of the top bunks, which were perceived as being more secure places to sleep compared to the lower bunks. I don't recall there being any guards or order other than a vague understanding about our fate, which was to stay in this place. Perhaps to try to leave would be severely punished by captors unseen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barack's voice came on, and said, My fellow citizens, this has been a long, hard campaign, and I am very tired. It's a rocky path I must travel and I just don't know if I can make it.

I thought it might be an earthquake, given the ferocity. I tried to relax my body and ride it out. The whole building crashed to the ground, but I was unharmed.

She sits us down on the sofa and confesses that she's got cancer, but that it can't get out because it could ruin the election. We're all really sad and I start to change my mind about voting for Obama. But then I geek out and tell her it's all going to be okay because that happened to President Roslin on BSG and she ended up all right. Hillary looked at me all funny, like What the hell are you talking about and what is BSG? (That's Battlestar Gallactica.) I'm like, Never mind, then we all start strategising about how to keep this from leaking to the media.

He would run the rainbows through this spaghetti-like shredder and turn them into a pool of muck. All the little color kids were slowly getting younger and younger until they melted into the muck, too. Then there was this little outcast girl whose color didn't fit into the rainbow (it was teal or mint) and she alone had the power to stop the rock monster.

I sat in the passenger seat and had a hard time clicking the seat belt closed. We drove in silence and I kept looking over at her, trying to figure out what to say. She was a good driver, though a bit of a tailgater (which makes me nervous). At some point, I was suddenly in the back seat, right behind her, and I had a big stack of papers on my lap that I was sorting into piles on the seat next to me. I was holding some paper clips between my teeth, which is perhaps why I spoke with a German-Russian accent. I told her, Senator Clinton, ma'am, I would be happy to drive if you have something else you need to do, but she just smiled and kept driving. On a highway we had to stop short just as we would have passed under a bridge, since a road crew was blocking almost the whole road, filling in a giant, muddy, watery hole right in front of us that had an orange road barrier sticking out of it, with more barriers around the hole. The workers were very focused on their jobs and didn't look up. Hillary opened the door and got out, looking around, and so did I, thinking she wanted me to drive now. The workers began elbowing each other and muttering in South-of-the-Thames accents, Isn't that Hillary, love? Then we got back in the car and she drove - backing up and turning to drive across the wide median to the other side of the highway, and we headed back the way he had come. She looked at me through the rear-view mirror and asked why I wanted to drive. I said, surprised that it wasn't obvious, Well, ma'am, because you are the next President of the United States, and I want to help you. I'm sure there is something you want to do besides driving the car. Even if it's thinking. Thinking is very important. I want to help you become the next President of the United States. She grew thoughtful. We arrived at a dining hall at the University of Virginia (my undergrad). Bill Clinton was there. My heart leapt and I blushed when I saw him. Hillary and I got separated. I knew I was supposed to be meeting someone else there, yet I also knew that I was responsible for bringing the Clintons to the dining hall. Strange security measures were in place there: trays bolted to tables, everything brightly lit, only one direction to walk in. I got a tray, silverware, an empty glass, and a monkey dish of pineapple. The Clintons and I sat in a row at a table and started talking. Then my parents -- as they were 18 years ago -- came up to us. I introduced them, but the Clintons already knew who they were. My Dad did a happy little jig, kicking his feet up, then my Mom pulled him away.

He speaks in a low, quiet voice, but then I start to notice something strange: Obama has an incredibly dirty mouth. He's on the phone, cussing up a storm. The phone seems to rile him and as he gets angrier, his voice gets louder and louder, and his language gets more and more profane and deranged. I try hard to concentrate on my magazine, but the more I try to, the more disturbed I become. He never yells at me, but he is positively out-of-control with rage at this point. Then Michelle Obama enters the room, also furious. She starts yelling at her husband, and the reason why becomes clear very quickly -- she's brandishing two Playboy magazines, which she apparently found in Barack's desk. Apparently, he promised her he would get rid of them and reneged. Michelle is raging away, but at this point, Obama seems to have calmed down. Instead of answering Michelle, he just sits at his desk and takes it, a big dumb grin playing across his face. The more she threatens him, the bigger the grin and the more smug his body language becomes. More people gather, mostly women. At this point, the entire office seems to be yelling at Obama, while he does nothing. Nobody notices me as I tiptoe out of the room, paperwork still unsigned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a huge PA, although I can’t remember what I was hearing out of it, and there was lots of food that we were perusing. For some reason, we left the park and went into this building that I felt was a public welfare center for bums (like me, ha ha!) Mostly Spanish-speaking people were there with small children, but a few elders were there. There was a courtesy pay phone, with which you didn’t have to pay to make a call. People were standing in line to use it. I got in line, since I felt I had to make a call to DBS to find out why they sent me new paperwork in the mail.

I think it was about Mego or David Murdock. I felt it was the FOH person (Savage) though. His mixing board was actually a huge theatre organ console with three manuals!! It was white, like Rich and Dorrie’s. The next thing I knew, I was with Mom, at one of her live shows. We were not only sitting in the front row, but I was actually sitting up high, like I always fantasize, so that I was actually on the stage level, and I could see everything! But things were still a little far away, and I was having trouble seeing anyway. But, she was wearing the white outfit that you see in the Vegas DVD. She was trying to put on this blow-up white costume to make herself look bigger, for some reason!! And it was falling off of her! But don’t worry, she had her other costume on underneath. Mom rushed up to the stage and helped her tie it on, and tried to fix it, just like she does to me all the time. Celine was so grateful that she came down to where I was sitting and gave us each a big hug! She had her short blonde hair. When she spoke to me, she didn’t have the unmistakable beautiful accent that defines her voice. She actually sounded like a prim and proper elder English lady.

5244,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"I had a bizarre dream last night! Well, the scene was this: Sandra was in town, and we were getting ready to go on some trip with her, like to the springs before Mom and Dad went to my relative’s home town. I was preparing to go on this trip, but I really didn’t want to. This dream was set in the relative ”old days” before Sandra had any children. I was upstairs organizing my jewelry and stuff. It was dusk. Somehow, I pulled a big doll out of a tiny drawer in a jewelry box! That was like a magic trick! It was the Josephina doll, and she had two skirts on. I was trying to decide if they were to be both worn at once, or separately. I danced her around my bed, and put her aside. Then, I started going through my top dresser drawer which had all kinds of loose jewelry in it, and I was trying to establish some kind of conceivable order to it all. I found two sets of African American style earrings that had bells on them, and I decided that I might wear them for June-Teenth. (In this dream, the date hadn’t yet passed, I guess.) They weren’t big and gaudy, but small and dainty. I decided to put them in a small box to keep them together. I opened my middle drawer and found a small box in there. I put the earrings in the box and put it aside, then picked up another, slightly larger box from my middle drawer, wondering what was in it. I took the lid off to find cotton covering whatever was inside. Suddenly, a stranger’s voice said, “What is this all about?!” Suddenly, it was dark. I didn’t see him, but I had the notion that this stranger was some cousin of Sheryl, Sandra and Sam’s, from Dawn’s side of the family. He had stayed with us while I was in Union City, so I hadn’t even known him, but nevertheless, he had stayed in my room, and this was now just as much his home as it was mine. Apparently, he had returned to stay with us indefinitely again. Mom appeared out of thin air at the same time, and said something to him about, “You and your prickly cables.” I came to realize that this strange boy, about 15 or 16 was an electric guitarist with lots of strange gear. Someplace in his rig, there was a DC 12 V power source, just to give things a little extra kick even though he mostly drew on the AC 110 V which is native to the house. Because of this, when his quarter-inch leads were disconnected from his equipment, and thrown haphazardly into the middle drawer in my dresser, they still carried a bit of a charge, of which one was sharply reminded if they happened to touch the metal jacks when rummaging around in the drawer. I realized at that moment that the slightly larger box which I was holding was his DC 12 V battery for his rig! In this dream, I had conceived such a thing as being about the size of a 9 V, but of course, having a 12 V value, but carrying many more amperes. I quickly put the lid on and put it back in the drawer. I closed the middle drawer, realizing that it contained most of his bizarre stuff. That stuff had been in there ever since I’d come home from Union City! He had more stuff laying around too. None of it was actually that large. In this dream, I didn’t feel the usual respect that I feel for other musicians, in fact, I hardly thought of this strange guest as a musician. I felt very violated that he could put things with that perceived danger into my personal space without my knowing it, and claim my room and my bed as his own. Then, suddenly, I realized that it was 5:30 AM, and we were getting ready to go on that trip. I got up and got dressed. He argued with me that the top right drawer was now his, even though I had all of my hair decorations and everything already in it. He had plopped himself in front of my dresser and was working with his stuff. His almost non-existent guitar playing was combined with CD playback, feedback loops and other-worldly effects! (Sounds like something I would have done at his age if I could have!!) But his mix freaked me out, it was “non-music!” It sounded like something you’d hear on 98 Rock, taken to a far-out extreme. I thought in my mind how, if he was playing old-school rock like Jimmy Hendrix or Led Zeplin, I’d totally be able to relate, and would love it. But this strange music of his was very unsettling. I was putting on my underwear and a T shirt, and I was only a little self-conscious about him watching me dress. I went into the bathroom to put on my bra. Then, Sandra opened the bathroom door and kissed me good morning. Light streamed into the room at last from the hallway. At that moment, the stranger with the freaky music disappeared, but I felt he was still in the house, maybe eating breakfast before we all were to get on the road. I could finally finish dressing in peace, and finally hear something on the radio that was normal and sane! Then, I woke up!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5255,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"Before that dream, I woke up to go to the bathroom, and it was 2:30 AM. I must have been wondering if I was really sleeping. Gosh, that was strange. Finally, I dreamed that for some reason, I hadn’t graduated from School yet, but that I had to leave in the middle of my degree for a few months. In this dream, I was coming back to Union City. We had attended some kind of parade downtown, and then, it was time for me to go back to my apartment. I had the notion that Jill had to leave the school for a while too, and I wasn’t sure if she’d returned yet or not. I walked into our apartment which was mostly barren. Only a few pieces of furniture were there. I had my head wrapped in a towel as though I’d just washed my hair. I walked into Jill’s room and flipped on the lights. The TV also came on. She was there. She awoke, startled, and I apologized for bothering her, explaining that I wanted to know if she was here or not. She sort of curtly guided me back to my own room. I took off my towel and lay on my bed, which was the one piece of furniture in my room. The air conditioner was on full blast, as it usually was with her. I had all kinds of doubts and fears. I had left most of the things home that I would need, and I didn’t even know if my dream school would take me back after being away so long. Mostly, I was just feeling very unpleasant about having to live with this girl who was my roommate. I dug through my bag for my cell phone so that I could call the school, and then I woke up suddenly and saw the light streaming in through the windows. I thought to myself, “I did graduate from School!!” I thought back to how wonderful the experience was for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5256,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"I had a dream Sunday morning that surprised me. The first little vignette was that I was back at my high school taking APC courses, and that I was way late for one of them. And the next little scene, totally out of the blue, I was in Spain with Mom, sitting in a park in the middle of a busy Downtown Madrid. It actually felt a lot like my hometown. To me, but I knew I was in Madrid. I wasn’t in any specific place that I remember, just a park that looked like one of ours. The backstory was that there was some kind of falling-out between Mom and Dad on their trip, and that she flew back home. (I thought Dad was still in my relative’s home town with the truck). She had talked to me briefly and then took off to the airport again, to Spain. She would paint there, and generally absorb the culture and the society until things blew over at home. I thought to myself in a quick moment, “I’ve got to get over there and find her! She doesn’t know the language at all, and she’s gonna’ get lost and frustrated if I don’t get over there pronto! Besides, I wanna be there to share the experience. I don’t wanna just sit at home, knowing Dad will be home any day in a snit.” I don’t remember how I got there, and how I found her in the middle of the big city, but somehow, I did. (This comes from the Shirley Temple movies). When the action begins, Mom and I were lying on a blanket and she was helping me with math homework. While I was trying to calculate something on my dark-lined, elementary-school paper, she was telling me how she had made arrangements for us to stay with a family already and several other things. I was incredulous since I knew she doesn’t speak a word of Spanish. And then, my practical side began to worry. We would be staying in Spain for two months, and I had already started APC in this dream. How would it be practical for me to continue my studies? I felt that we’d made some vague arrangements to send my work through the mail. I came up with a little Spanish song about how, “You can’t speak Spanish and I can’t read signs, so how are we to get by?” And then, we were feeding bread to ducks, just like we do here, and I slowly began to realize that this was all a dream. I was actually quite relieved. But before I really woke up, I dreamed that I was sitting at a desk in school writing all of this out in a Spanish essay on heavy-lined paper. From what I remember writing in this dream, I was pleased with the sentences that I formed and the words that I chose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5258,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"I had a pretty goofy dream last night. Mom says I should draw a picture with one scene fading into the next, but I don’t know how on earth I’d ever do that. But anyway, here’s how it unfolded. First, I was walking with Jack down the winding path on 26th Ave. We were talking about trees and houses and stuff. His voice was weaker and more frail than in reality, and it grew weaker as we walked. I remember we were contented, just strolling along. I felt at peace just being with him, but I kept thinking, “We’ve got to get back to his house and let him rest.” Then, next thing I knew, I was with Dad, in this old dilapidated house. It belonged to someone on the Neighborhood board who’s close to Dad, but I wasn’t sure who. They’d gone off for the summer and asked Dad to babysit the house in the meantime. Dad was there to fix a refrigerator, of all things! I felt that I remembered an upright piano in this house. Although it would most likely be beat-up and out-of-tune, I was anxious to practice on it while Dad fixed the fridge. I believe he was looking forward to hearing me too. So I began to look for it. In the place where I remembered it being, there was instead a computer workstation on top of a small chest of drawers. For some reason, I sat down before the equipment thinking that somehow I could try to play anyway! But instead of the keys, my hands touched a covered printer. On top of the printer I found a toilet brush! So I looked all over the house for that mysterious upright, even behind the couches in the living room which were pulled away from the wall!! (The living room looked a lot like Linda’s). I began to give up hope, standing in the middle of the living room. But then I remembered that the house owners had donated it to the hotel across the street from us, that was about to be demolished. (Really, it was demolished 3 years ago and is now townhomes.) Since the building was coming down in a matter of weeks, Dad and I felt we had the right to snoop through it. (Dad really did snoop through the real building, retrieving armfuls of useful stuff, especially good lumber from the floors!!) So I felt that after he fixed the fridge, we could go over to the hotel building and I could practice on it anyway. I even thought that we could just retrieve it altogether the way Dad did the wood from the floors! Then, I slowly woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5260,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"I had a crazy, crazy dream last night! (Oh, by the way, crazy dreams mean I’ve been sleeping well). In this dream, Mom had some kind of trip planned, to Asia, India, China, or someplace in the east like that. She was going to stay about 2 months. I didn’t really have that much of a desire to travel to that part of the world (not a strong desire like I have to one day go to Europe again). I decided, however, two days before Mom left, that I didn’t want to stay home with just Dad in the house for 2 months, so I decided I was packing my bags and going with her. I was going to miss lots of school, and I was figuring what to do about that, but I was okay with that. The actual action in this dream began with some quick, disorganized, inadequate packing. I wasn’t packing too much at all, just two tops, a bra, one pair of shorts and some underwear. I decided I’d throw in a sketch pad too. Then, I was downstairs on the night of our departure. Our flight was supposed to leave at 10:00 PM, and we were supposed to have been at the airport at 9. But of course, it was 10:20 and Mom was still fiddling and diddling around the house!! I felt, however, that there were other flights throughout the night that we could get on without a problem. And we were to ride the tandem to the air port!! To make this situation even sillier, we were taking Peboo with us! Pete and Genevieve were out of town, and we just couldn’t leave the little birdy all by himself. So we put him in my bag, which had lots of room since I hadn’t packed much at all. So, he did just what you’d expect any little bird to do, he made a mess in my bag. But it was a big mess, more like about what a pigeon would leave, and my bag stunk to high heaven! There was no way we were going to slip that through the airport! So, there we were, stopping with the tandem outside of 711 late at night, on our way to the airport, having to clean up my bag. And then, I woke up!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5262,,,,,,,05-31-2006,"I had a funny dream last night. Our house had three stories again, just like in some previous dreams. The third story was very much like Grammy’s second story. To get there, you had to use an elevator since the stairs were HUGE and virtually unclimbable. But the elevator was almost as scary since I couldn’t really be sure that it would work right. In the first little scene of this dream, I was in a church. I had the notion that it had an organ, but the focus was going to be the very large chorus. I was sitting in theater style seats with the audience, rather than pews. Some woman that I thought I knew touched me and offered to help me move closer, away from Mom and Dad and some other people that I thought I knew. The concert was to begin shortly. She successfully moved me to a better spot, then sat down beside me. I felt funny because we whispered and talked through the first moments of the performance, and thought that the people around us would think badly of us. Then, I faded into a scene where I was roller skating through this HUGE third story of our house. I must have been a little kid in this dream, because everything around me looked HUGE. (That’s why the steps were so huge. Grammy’s steps were narrow and steep to begin with, and as a kid, they must have seemed insurmountable to me). This expanse of wood floors and little area rugs was totally empty except for some furniture here and there. No more of Grammy’s clutter was piled around. (Now on the other side, she must have come to terms with the fact that she doesn’t need it). As I skated from room to room, I had the feeling that I would just have to stay up there for a while, stuck in never-never land until someone came up to help me down. I kind of wanted to come back to reality, to the house as I know it, but I was somewhat contented. Then, I skated into a room that had a boom box. Mom and Uncle Richard were messing with it. It was on a rather wiggly table. My heavy tromps, shifting my weight from one leg to the next, caused the CD player to skip. I decided to sit down and not make it do that. Then, I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5265,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"So, after all of that, I fell asleep and had a crazy, non-congruous dream. I dreamt that Mom and I were watching this one opera, comprising arias and songs from a wide variety of eras! First, we were in a traditional hall, in the front row, listening to a young soprano singing Puccini’s “O Mio Babbino Caro” in front of colorful sets that I couldn’t identify, (mirroring my vision in real life). The cast sang something else, a bit more lively, and then, I was outside, by the waterfront, walking along a private dock holding hands with a 5th grade boy. I couldn’t decide if he was my student or my child-like playmate. (In other words, I couldn’t figure out if I was his teacher, or if I was a child just like him.) We were stepping over large gaps in this dock, knowing that we really shouldn’t be walking it, to the tune of “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring”, supposedly still part of this same opera. We were in it now, for some reason. Then, I was in the kitchen with Mom. Supposedly, it was 4:00 in the morning, and she had an oil lamp lit. She was blasting a lively part of this same opera on her Bose machine. I think it was the Met broadcast, and they were doing a gospel number, something I have never heard them do! We were clapping, dancing and having a ball. I commented on the piano part, that could clearly be heard. I imitated the deep, rich bass line with my left hand in mid-air, pointing it out to Mom. Dad was in bed sleeping, but we were having a PAR-TY! I only began to worry at the end a little bit. Then, it was supposedly 7:30 in the morning, and Mom and I were listening to still the same opera on her Bose machine. This time it was “Memory” and “Music of the Night.” In this dream, I felt these songs had been written at the same time as Puccini’s aria. After all, they were part of the same show! At that point, Dad got out of bed and quietly, sleepily admonished us for having such a good time in the kitchen with total disregard for the time of day. Then, I awoke, grateful that the house had been silent all night long. It was really 3:00 in the morning. I shuffled to the toilet and back, then had some kind of continuation of this dream, but I can’t remember it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5268,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"Last night, I had kind of a bad dream; one of those rehearsals of how to survive a dangerous situation, I guess, but again -- I wish those crazy dreams would let me alone!! I have to tell myself not to dream these things!! This time, there was a cute little house close to 4th Street that I was thinking of moving into. The only downside was that it had a security system. I “decreed” that it must be disconnected before I would live there. Somehow, we managed to get in and look around and visit with the previous owners uneventfully. The company’s representative would be coming out to disconnect it. When he arrived, I began to run away from the house. I ran a block or so, and came to a beach. Here, Mom and Dad and I, and some other people were swimming and generally relaxing and having a good time. Somehow, Uncle Carl showed up here too! It was nightfall by then. He had found a dog that he said I should adopt. He was named Fellow, and was about Bella’s size. He wasn’t quite a guide dog, but Carl and I seemed to think that he would almost act like one. Carl said that Fellow was Jewish because he didn’t really believe in the Resurrection. He said that Fellow believed that women had polluted the human population with sin so much that it was irreversible!! I said that was just fine, but thought to myself that if I could get him to listen to Christian radio, I might be able to change his mind!! (Boy, is that ridiculous or what!!) So, we were riding our bikes at this point. But then, in the next scene, actually an ongoing jumble of scenes, I realized that my little house on 4th street was not going to be for me. Not only were the previous people staying, and leaving their system firmly in place, but the salesperson was a sly ol’ devil. He and Dad had hatched a plan to wire up our house too, all in the name of protecting me… I felt as if I was on a roof and someone pulled away the ladder. I went in the cellar to get water or something and found some electronic gadgetry with flashing lights covered up by a shirt or something. This situation, I felt, grew more complicated all the time, and was planned in secret. I wasn’t supposed to hear about it for a time. Each moment, I grew more afraid. In one scene, I opened the back door and heard the quiet beep indicating limited time (an aural ticking time bomb). Then, I was sitting on the picnic table with Mom. It was before Christmas, and I said, “My Christmas wish is that all of this would just be taken out!!” I mentioned Fellow, and how he would surely protect me in my little house on 4th Street, from whatever wolves might tap at the door, and how powerless and afraid I felt. But ya’ know how she passively goes along with whatever he does, or wants to do. She didn’t say a word, just touched me a little, thinking that she was comforting me. Then, I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5269,,,,,,,05-31-2006,"I slept well and had a really goofy dream last night! First, I dreamed that we were shopping for an above-ground swimming pool that was pretty big. I couldn’t believe we were buying such a thing. I wasn’t upset, just surprised. I was swimming in several, trying them out, worrying a little about what sort of things I might encounter in them. I was also talking to Dad about him teaching me to ride horses someday, and was a bit disappointed when he laid out some practical reasons why I couldn’t. (I haven’t said anything to him in reality about horseback riding, but I don’t think he would react this way. This is more like Mr. Harland’s reaction to my wish to conduct.) So, I was hanging in the water, gripping the side of one of these pools, in a store, talking to Dad about horseback riding, and the next thing I knew, I was in a classroom, before an immature orchestra of students, trying to conduct them and lead a rehearsal. They were getting ready for some kind of concert. I don’t know how I got there, why I was there, or what I was going to do. I knew nothing about the scores that they were playing, but I had them laid out on a big, wide, orange podium table at the front of the room, and there was a big, tall chair that I sat in before the slightly slanted table. (I know conductors never sit at their podiums, but for some reason, in this dream, there was a chair.) The orchestra members were arranged in the usual way, but at the front, there was an accordion, a piano and an organ! For the first piece, I picked up the score and my magnifier and looked at the meter, which was common time. Then, I quickly put it down, having no time to study anything else. I felt very inept and unprepared to lead them, and I knew that they knew it too. Nevertheless, they had to rehearse today, and I was it. Sitting in my big chair, I gave them a full measure of count-off, and then, they began to play on the third beat of the second bar. I thought to myself, “Gee, I don’t know whether this piece has an upbeat or not!” So, they played, and they inspired me to some degree. Feeling restricted in my chair, I climbed down and stood beside the large orange podium. I had no clue what was coming next, or who to cue when, but I gave them the time, and somewhat of a dynamic direction once I had a feel for the character of the piece. (This is sort of how I do when I hear an orchestral piece that I’m somewhat familiar with, and I feel compelled to stand up and start conducting for the sound system who isn’t following me anyway!) It was exactly that way before these students in my dream. I didn’t use any separate gestures for dynamics, just the size and intensity of the beats. (Because I’m a pianist, this just seems more natural to me, even though I know that it’s not correct. When you play the piano, your touch is everything. There’s no additional movements necessary to alter the dynamics. I guess I could think in the future of being an organist, and that dynamics gestures are more like pulling out or canceling stops.) Then, they finished that piece. The next piece was an organ solo. For that piece, I sat down in my big chair and let the organist play for himself. The students became more and more off-task, and didn’t listen quietly as they should have. I didn’t know how to get their attention back, and I was mortified. I felt that I didn’t deserve their respect anyway. Then, I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5270,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journald:jasmine details,05-31-2006,"I had a quite nice dream for a change. Last night, I started out dreaming that Shadow was coming to stay with us for a while. For some reason, he’d been bouncing back and forth from living with John to living with us, and was having a hard time adjusting to it all. He was drinking water in the kitchen. And then, that little dream faded into something where I was with Mrs. Dougherty’s choir. She and about 15 students were all in our kitchen rehearsing. They were their usual boisterous selves, but this time, I felt I was her right-hand assistant. The students were people that I remember from the class. Some of them were misbehaving and goofing off, and as they did, Mrs. Dougherty would take them by the hand and make them sit in the living room. She was giving them some kind of lecture and just generally babysitting them. Meanwhile, I had about five sitting around our kitchen table, and I continued to rehearse and conduct them. We were singing “Bring a Torch, Janette Isabella” that has lots of little triplets in it. I couldn’t decide whether to to conduct a very fast 6/8 or just a 2/4. I didn’t have a score in front of me. So I said, “Ariana, is this written in 6/8 or in 2/4?” (Ariana was one of the best musicians among us.) She said, “It’s in 2/4.” So I said, “Alright, I’ll give you this.” I stood up and made a broad sweeping down-up 2/4 gesture with both hands. Mrs. Dougherty was standing behind me and said, “Now you see, ladies and gentlemen, that kind of talking is very productive. When you talk to each other in rehearsal, please try to be productive.” A girl next to me said, “Oh, you just like her better.” With that, Mrs. Dougherty took her hand and led her into the living room as she cried loudly, just as a toddler would do. She stayed out there for quite a while with the misbehavers. After that, I realized that if I just gave them a 2/4, they might not sing the triplets together enough. So then, I decided to give them lots of little 3s with only my wrist. Then, we were singing “We Wish you a Merry Christmas”, and I was conducting in ¾ with my whole forearm, as usual. My left hand stayed at my side. During this song, I found myself in the middle of a library or airport with the 5 or so attentive students. There were about two boys and three girls. We were all singing, and I was conducting in their midst rather than in front. I would look behind me now and then, hoping they could still see me. I had no instruments to help lead them, nor did I when I was in the kitchen. We were having trouble staying on pitch, just like Forest and Shantelle. Then, Mrs. Dougherty joined us again. I was willing to step back into the ranks and let her lead again, but I really didn’t want to. She seemed to know this, so she stepped behind me and took my wrists in her hands, just like Jack had done. She used both of my hands, guiding my right to do the typical ¾ thing. For some reason, when we got to “Good tidings we bring…” she had me extend my arm out all the way to my right and kind of shake my fingers in an odd way. That was goofy. Then, I woke up. I wonder what this dream means.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5271,,,,,,,05-31-2006,"I was having quite a dream last night. Pete and Genevieve, Mom and I were going to this little restaurant that had a piano that had agreed to let me come and practice, partly to get ready for my performance, and partly to entertain their customers. When this dream began, I was on a balcony with Mom and Pete and Genevieve, descending a set of narrow, precarious spiral steps, of the same sturdy mesh material that APC’s picnic tables are made of. (This was like a Baywalk complex). In the courtyard, there were cute little tables with plastic yellow umbrellas covering them. It was very hot in the sun out in this courtyard, but I felt that once winter came, it would be beautiful out there. I said to Mom, “Hey, I think we’ve found another little hide-out!” We all went into the restaurant, which looked like a combination of Panera’s and the coffee shop where I used to bring my keyboard. We sat down at a table, and began to chatter. I was in my night gown, but felt that was okay since musicians tend to be very eccentric at times!!! We saw Dana from the testing center, and this other family that I thought we knew. Pete said, “Well Jasmine, you can start practicing, and we’ll be along shortly.” I thought about how I could sit around and drink coffee and gab any ol’ time, but this was special, and I had to get down to business. But, I was at a loss for where their instrument was located. I was just about to scout around and look for it, when I heard someone begin to play it. Of course this was a big help in finding it, but it meant that someone else was already playing it, and I’d have to wait a while. I figured it wouldn’t be long though. I followed my ears to a special little room. There, I found a beautiful 6-foot grand piano with a black mirrory finish. The small cabinet lid was folded back. Around it were some other chairs, and racks full of wine bottles and other little gifty thingies. The paned glass door to this room was usually open, so that the sound could waft through to the restaurant customers, but if one desired, they could close the door and have some woodshed practice time. A girl about 12 or 13 was playing at the time, and she actually wasn’t bad. She was playing something on the order of Album for the Young or the more advanced Thompson tunes. I sat down right next to her on one of the extra chairs. She came with the family that I thought I knew, but didn’t really know. (She was probably Meghan, for she played too well to be Astrid!!) We chatted happily, for I was anxious to befriend this girl. She let me have the bench for a moment, and I think I played something for her, although I can’t remember. She seemed to want to play longer, so I gave the bench back to her. (I was thinking that I should let her play for a few more minutes, and then, her family will leave and I can seriously practice after that). She seemed to only politely acknowledge my playing (as Astrid does) but really wasn’t that interested. Her playing seemed to sound worse to me. She seemed to be banging out nothing as does a small child. I was thinking, “Geez, I hope the restaurant people don’t think this is me!” One of us had closed the door by this time. Worse yet, she said she wanted to put a little barbed-wire grid against the hammers to make the sound much softer and more mellow. The restaurant had somehow locked the large cabinet lid to prevent just such things from happening, but this girl boasted that her father had given her a key. I got her attention back and explained to her that her barbed wire was very un-necessary. After all, that’s what the soft pedal was designed to do! I explained to her how it works and asked that she try it. She seemed satisfied with the result. While all of this was going on, it was getting dark outside, and I felt we had already overstayed our welcome. Finally, I told the girl that I needed to play for a while since I had a recital tomorrow. (In this dream, it was Friday night). She seemed apologetic and sheepish, but again, she seemed flighty like she didn’t have a clue. She said a quick goodbye and rushed out the door, closing it behind her. Just then, Pete came in to kind of let me know that the time was up. He seemed to realize what had happened, even though I wasn’t sure if he noticed. He sat down in one of the other chairs, and I started into my diabeli rondo. But I couldn’t get very far. To begin with, the piano was behaving as if the sustain pedal was stuck down. (Oh, that dratted little girl who took up all of my practice time, from afternoon to night, what had she done to it!!) I felt it with my foot, and it was in deed stuck down!! I was able to work my toe under it and pop it back to its right position. (Seriously, I don’t think this could ever happen, squeaky as they can be!) And then, I was so upset and flustered that I just couldn’t play for beans! As I tried in vain, I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think it was for some new guests or something. And we were kind of at a place that was kind of like our house and kind of like something different. And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with a big roof and white in the front, and they made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass. And then I went along down through the buffet and I got through these things. And I can’t remember what the significance of all this was. There had to be more to it, but heck if I remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5293,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalb:jasmine details,09-05-2003,"(363) I was having kind of an interesting dream last night. Let’s see, how should I start? Well, first of all, I don’t know if I was back at my high school or still at my college, but I had some classes to go to, and I was oftentimes I would go like to the bathroom in between classes. Well, in this one class that I was in, I met the teacher and she said that I really needed to not be late so much because I was getting behind in material. And, oh, this is so weird – this class was a PE/ Music class. We were going to be like singing, but she said we had to get stronger by doing things like sit-ups and lifting weights and stuff. And so we would do a combination that, and I think there were like no more desks and I was like standing in the back of the room, and she was teaching us about theory, and she was showing how chromatic scales are a lot easier to play, but major scales sound better and more complete. And I’m trying to think, I don’t remember the examples she gave. This room was like kind of small, but there were like, I don’t know, two or three rows with people in front of where I was standing, if that means anything. And this teacher was like a nice woman, she was wearing jeans, I think. And I don’t think Mrs. Dougherty ever wore jeans, and I don’t think Mrs. Hager did either, but she seemed like jeans was like something about her personality that she was more like Mrs. Hager, more casual and what have you. But suddenly the scene like shifted, and I was at home and I was fixing some kind of lunch for myself, and I hear this funny sound in the living room and I can’t figure out what it is. And Mom said that she had borrowed and brought home a Yamaha Clavinova, not from Dr. Moran’s lab, but from this teacher. And she said that the teacher had told her that I was kind of like, kind of bashful about touching it, and she wanted my mom to work with me with it. And let’s see, the thing of it was, when you would walk towards it, it would make this funny buzzing sound, like when you first, I don’t know, a feedback loop in the lower frequency range, I guess you could say. But it didn’t do that at home, I don’t know why, so I saw it in the living room and Mom was trying to convince me to sit down in front of it, and it started shrinking and shrinking and shrinking, and before I knew it, it was the size of something for a Barbie doll. And then I woke up. Well, wait a minute, one other crazy twist I remember about this dream: when it was shrinking and shrinking, Mom like took a piece off of it, and I realized that it was chocolate with like vanilla frosting, and that it really wouldn’t make any sound if I were to touch it and try to carry a tune. So she cut off a piece of the chocolate from the edge and I had a bowl of ice cream and she just threw this piece of chocolate in my bowl of ice cream. And I really didn’t want to finish my ice cream, but I woke up before I could.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5309,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalb:jasmine details,09-05-2003,"(354) Last night I was dreaming that I had to go to school at my college and I had to ride a bus, and for some reason my classes didn’t start until 9:00 o’clock so the bus could wait until 8:25 to come and it would be okay. Well, let’s see, oh, first of all, I dreamt that, well, first of all in real life, there’s a substitute teacher that comes in to electronics class when Mr. Martin is out, his name is James Hill. In my dream James Hill didn’t think I was doing up-to-par work, and I was going to write this paper to prove what I knew and I was going to hurry up and write it long-hand before the bus came in the morning. And I can’t remember what we were talking about, but Dad and were laying on the bed talking and talking and talking and before I knew it, all my time was gone and I didn’t get to write the paper. And then – this is the crazy part – there was this candy bar, actually on all the Phi Beta Kappa candy bars I had the notion that they would look interesting if we drew some kind of picture with like frosting. And I seem to recall the wrapper having that kind of picture, and before I knew it some kid ran up on the porch and offered me three treats out of his Halloween pumpkin if he could give me back one of the candy bars he bought from me, and that was cool. And I used that one, and I could have sworn the wrapper was going to have some picture on it for us to draw from, but it didn’t. And I was saying how, if I had the time, I would be creative and I would draw little things in each square, but I didn’t have that kind of time. And I can’t remember why I put it . We were eating pizza for breakfast, the leftovers of Brittany’s pizza, and I think I remember something else, just before I woke up and Dad was walking out the door, he said something like, “But I’m not sure, but you guys just hate it!” And then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5325,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalb:jasmine details,09-05-2003,"(552) It’s late at night again. I am a bad procrastinator. Last night I had a dream, a really, really weird dream, that I was back at my high school again, I was in the Little Theater, the small theater where Mrs. Dougherty and her chorus used to rehearse, and there was a big acoustic grand piano on stage with a dark finish. But it had this electrical switch wired to the wooden ledge above the keys, and the reason why this existed like this is so that the performer could sit on stage and warm up and get ready to perform, and then he wouldn’t have to get up for anything. He could just flip this switch on the ledge there and the curtains would open and the lights would dim and he wouldn’t have to move. And he could just address his audience. But the only thing was that something weird, something wasn’t wired right with this wiring, and so instead of the curtains opening and the lights dimming, the fire alarm would go off. And so the theater is kind of empty when I’m in there and it’s starting to fill up gradually and I’m waiting for this concert and I’m really getting excited about this concert that they’re going to do. And I was with a girl, a friend named Mary Lou, and she was sitting a few rows back and I got to see her when she was a year younger than me. I was still in high school, I guess, in this dream. And then I heard the people in neighboring seats chattering to me about how this wiring might not be so great anyway, and so it’s time for him to perform, it’s time for the pianist to come out and perform. And I’m like so afraid because of this, because I think the alarm is going to sound when he wants to dim the lights or something. And so, sure enough, that’s what happened, but I didn’t hear any alarm sounds in the Little Theater. It was like outside, outside in the hallways. But I’m so afraid that I’m yelling for Mary Lou to come. And I got up and I ran down the aisle and Mary Lou ran after me and we ran outside before the rest of the school alarms went off. Now I wonder where in the world all of this is coming from. I think the part about being back at my high school and stuff is the fact that I’ve been going through and putting all of my other dreams into mp3 files and Audio Audition, and, you know, I’ve been hearing my voice evolve sort of, and, you know, I’ve had lots of dreams about my high school and fire drills and stuff, and I think that might just be coming back to me. And, of course, Jim had me practice on his big acoustic one yesterday, so I had that exposure. But I can’t help thinking there’s a little more to do this, and it’s sad. But that’s the gist of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5342,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalb:jasmine details,09-05-2003,"(420) I had a pretty whacked out dream last night. I keep having dreams that I’m at this school that’s a combination of my high school and my college, and I keep waffling back and forth. I didn’t do that when I came from Bancroft and went to my high school, so I don’t know what’s going on here. But I was in the Media Building at my high school, but I was taking a class in one of the rooms like I would take at my college. And I was up on the third floor and I was with some other people. They weren’t like young people, but some of them were and some of them were like middle-aged older people. And class was kind of ending and everybody was just kind of sitting down and shuffling their books and stuff. And the fire alarm went off outside. You know how you don’t hear it in the room, but then you hear it outside in the hallway? Well, all of us took our good old time packing up our stuff. Apparently we knew it was just a drill or they were like testing it or something. So we took our good old time – that’s kind of crazy. And so – oh, I know – by the time we were ready to walk out the door, everybody had their stuff because we had to like go all together and we had to wait for everybody to pack their stuff. Well, when everybody had their stuff, the alarm shut itself off, and so I had this immense fear going on that it was going to happen again while we were out in the hallway and it was going to be terrible. And dragging my book bag and stuff, and we can’t really just go down the stairs because something is blocked or something, so we’ve got to go down these big ladder things and then walk across these like levels of concrete and then go down more big ladders and stuff. And we were all doing this with our stuff, and we got out to the, they had a bus circle at this place, and we were out to the bus circle and I thought I had missed my bus. So I was hopping a van with a lady and a couple of kids and they lived near me apparently and they were going to take me home. This van was a black van, if that makes any difference. And out there it looked like my high school. And as I was in the van, somebody said, “Well, you could take the bus. Your bus is still here. You can take the bus if you want.” And I don’t remember if I was on the bus or in the van coming home, but in my dream you had buses – school buses – to and from my college also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5358,,,,,,ID: jasmine_journalb:jasmine details,09-05-2003,"(530) Last night I had kind of a screwy dream. First I dreamt that Mom and I were riding around these antsy parking lots on the bike and she went to Public to do some shopping, and she took some of Public’s cards and was going to hand them out at the fruit stand. And Publics gave her three Easter baskets because of that. One was kind of a normal one, one was small, kind of like, and the other one was really small. And in the really small one there was a ducky and these four or five little clips that you clip bags together closed with, but she called them short-its, and when I thought these short-it things were, were things that you strip away some of the wire and you put this clip there, so that when somebody steps on it, it shorts out the circuit and goes, “Ahhhhhhhhh!” That’s funny. And so we rode the bike home, happy because we had all these Easter baskets and all these presents we were going to send people. And we got home and the front door was wide open, and now we’re talking about back in my home town and that’s like a major crime there. And the chicken was around pecking at some bread that was really, really moldy, and there was a bunch of garbage laying around the yard. And Dad was so sad about the fact that there was so much garbage around the yard and the chicken had moldy bread, and that the house hadn’t been swept in a week. And he was just so like in a blue funk, like he gets, except he was so down that he was questioning the quality of his life. And I said something to him, I think, and he just came back with some stupid comment, which he has been known to do that after Mom and Dad had had a falling out and I say something about going on and doing something else, he’ll come back with some really stupid comment sometimes. But anyway, in this dream I just went on about my business and I was sitting in the porch swing kind of talking to the bird, I guess, and then he came by and said, “You know, I think I know what would really make me happy. I would like to take a VCR to the park and watch an instructional video about adjusting brake alignment.” And he said that there was something in an engine called the equalizer adjustment. And I had the notion that it didn’t have to do with sound, but it had to do with the equalizing of how the parts lined up, kind of like timing is for real. But I thought it was strange that there was something termed like that in an engine, and so what would make him happy was to take a VCR to the park and watch a video about calibrating an engine basically. And so, now in real life, I don’t think that would do the trick. I’ll take a moment to tell a story here. In real life, when we were coming home from Janna’s wedding, that trip was the most awful trip I can remember in my life, and Dad was laying in the back seat and Mom was driving, and I was sitting up front with her. And when we stopped at a rest stop to eat some picnic, he turned his back and wouldn’t even touch any of the food or water that we were putting out, and when somebody came over to ask him about the car, he was like, “Yeah, thanks.” And usually he’s all excited and wanting to show them what’s what, and wanting to ask them about the one they used to have. But this time he was like, “Yeah, thank you.” So back to this dream. I think I said everything, and I think the reason why I’m thinking about, oh, I think the reason why I’m thinking about the word “equalizer” as being a part of an engine is because we had analog tape cal (?) lab last night, and it took me a while to understand that the tape EQ pot thing was really just an up or down boost for 10k only, and when you feed 10k through from the mil, you got to tweak the 10k thing so it’ll be even all around, you know what I mean?

In Spanish, Sra. Perez made fun of me because I couldn't speak properly and I had to bathe Mr. Singer in history. When I went to English, I couldn't find my homework and I got into big trouble. I had 2 double chemistry labs a week and it was just turning out to be the worst school year ever. Finally, I went to math one day and it was the same class I had freshman year, except it was in an English classroom. The big projector was down and all the lights were off. Everyone was having sex and Anthony and Lou were there and they wanted me to have sex. But I was scared, so I went home for Thanksgiving break. I was at Sue's house and I went through this door outside. I was on a big mountain. Lord Voldemort had returned and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us. No one else knew it was him, and for some reason, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. On the mountain were Ron and Hermione, and Sue and I were throwing turkey to them to save everyone. But behind them were a lot of other bad people, so we were trying to get rid of them without hurting Ron and Hermione. Finally Ron and Hermione got up the mountain, and Lord Voldemort walked right by us. Sue understood and we both left because we were scared. We went to the lake because we had to try to take a boat back to my high school. So we started carrying out boats to the shore and ran into Mrs. Carter, who told us that my high school had moved to France. We ignored her and kept walking with our boats to the shore. We got into the water except we weren't in the boats. There were little kids in the boats and Isabel and I had to safely get them across the lake to my high school and away from Lord Voldemort. There was a fish that grabbed onto me and when I shook it off, it started to have babies. Then a snapping turtle chased us to land. Then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Margo was there and we were looking for ice cream, before I realized I had to be babysitting. I ran into the main building and went down to the English wing, where there was a talk about college.

In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like ""Antique M&Ms,"" where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $10 and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $10. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy. When I finally got there though, Mrs. Frank and her two sons were all waiting for me. Apparently they were a day early. Mrs. Frank told me not to listen to Seth no matter what he said, and I was so confused I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I couldn't understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended 3 hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next 3 hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK.

First I was near the senior steps by the back of the dining hall, and my brother fell and landed with what I kept repeating in my head as ""a sickening crunch."" It was horrible. He had to be dead. Then I came home and my father had to fight these monsters working with Voldemort in the lake. He had a gun that looked like the remote control, and he got frustrated when I couldn't understand how it worked. I cut up his purple and white boxers to use as Clothies, because I didn't know when I'd see him again. My mother was tanning on the deck and I went inside the kitchen to be sad about my father leaving. I noticed the creamer standing outside the pantry. Slowly, it turned to face me. I got so scared. Fritz was evil and rabid and working with this creamer, trying to prove that my mother and I were anorexic. I ran upstairs because I was so scared. I went into my brother's room and jumped into his bed, nearly hysterical with fear, begging him to let me sleep there. My brother had this nail in his back, which I guess was serving as his stitches. The evil Fritz came in with the creamer and ripped the nail out of his back, and I screamed. Apparently, the nail was a family heirloom of Slytherin. There was also a cactus on my brother’s bedside table, and it was a Horcrux that Voldemort used. He recovered because all of a sudden, he and Russell and Ted and I were all on the run from Voldemort. We were running around London and my high school, which was in London, trying to escape. We ran into my room and my roommate was Ron. Hector was chasing us too. He wanted to kill my baby, because apparently I was pregnant. We are running everywhere and Ginny started to slow down. I started freaking out, but saw this French marching band on the Spanish Steps (I guess we got to Rome somehow). The band members were all dressed in brightly colored robes and were supposed to help us, but they didn't. They just kept playing their instruments and waving their flags. We tried to save my mother and get back to school. Then I was supposed to go on a date with Pete. This was right after hockey practice, so I went to the bathroom to try and primp myself. For some reason, I wet my pants, but it didn't matter. I came out and Ian began pouring his heart out, telling me I was the only one for him, and that he loved me.

Mrs. Crank was prowling Taylor and caught me hiding under Pete's bed. Although I thought it was OK, I still felt like I was doing something wrong. So then I was sent home for breaking check-in, and my father got really mad at me and lecture me in front of the whole boys' varsity hockey team. I was really embarrassed. Then I was at the refuge in the mountains with him and the boys' hockey team. A bus stopped and Lou got out. His footsteps made so much noise because he had gotten fat over the summer. Then my father was reading an updated version of The Great Gatsby, which was actually about Lou and me, and everything worked out in the end, and no one died. My favorite passage about their first kiss and the tuning fork (in the real book), had been rewritten about LOU giving me this look and me crying because he was convinced that he didn't like me. But then we got together in the end. That night I had to clean up the refuge for dinner. I began sweeping and mopping and Sophia got mad at me because she thought she had cleaned earlier, and that I was only cleaning because I thought she had done a bad job. So she got really pissed off. That night there was a big winter carnival with all sorts of sports games going on. Caroline wanted me to come watch her swim meet, but I wanted to watch the boys' hockey game. I went and remembered seeing Lou skate out onto the ice. I guess I started a new dream, because I was all of a sudden drafted for some war against England. My canon was stuck and I was so terrified. Then I got shot in the leg. I somehow ran to a boat collecting people, and Lou was there too for Christ's sake. We ended up in the Bermuda Triangle, where we got lost.

Sue was there and we were having a lot of fun. On the last day, we had to board buses to get us home. One kid was frantically telling us that when we got on the bus, they were going to give us an oxygen mask because of the altitude. Only it was a gas mask and if we put it on, we would die. Sue and I got on and held our masks to our faces, pretending we had them on. We saw a lot of kids put them on and then ""fall asleep."" We closed our eyes to pretend. The bus stopped and everyone who was alive got out, while they cleaned all the dead bodies off. Sue and I stood outside the bus, crying. When we got back on, they were going to gas the whole bus. I just remember thinking, ""This is it, no one will know I'm dead for a long time. I can never see my family or friends again.""

Something caused me to look up and I saw a tornado coming towards the house. I started running down the stairs, trying to get to the basement. Suddenly I feel the house lift up and move. I felt the sensation of it flying and then falling to the ground. That's all I remember.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5472,,,,,Female,ID: km2015:km details,06-29-2001,I was in a place like the DMV trying to get some paper work submitted for the website. Then I came home and some man had broken into my house. I was very upset and chased him out. When I got downstairs (this is a house I do not know) there were people out on the sun porch who I seemed to know. Then I had to go down to this office because I guess the man was trying to serve me papers or something. I get down there and they are trying to tell me I owe them money and I was trying to explain I did not. Once they looked it up they read off the address and it was wrong. I corrected them with my correct address and then tried to find my license to prove it but couldn't find it. I go outside and my car was parked in the grass and the grass had a lot of standing water as if it had flooded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5489,,,,,Female,ID: km2015:km details,06-29-2001,"Ok this one was strange, what dream isn't. Only certain parts stand out. The first part I am with some girl and we are hiking down this big hill, it was a very wooded area. We get to the bottom and I look up and there are these HUGE, and i mean HUGE, Hippos drinking water out of the lake. We are talking Hippos the size of someone's house. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I told her I had to go get my camera. To get up the hill, because it was so steep, we had this line that we attached ourselves to and it would pull us up, I started going up and remember getting scared. That's all I recall about that part of the dream. Next I am in my condo, the one I live in now. I hear someone yell my name out the windo and it was one of my mom's old friends. I was like ""Shit what is she doing here"", she said something to the affect that my mom told her and some other people to meet at my house. Why would she do this she KNOWS my house is a mess. *See in REAL life I am not the neatest person, granted not dirty just messy. My mom on the other hand is VERY neat so I rarely like her to come over because I know in her mind she will wonder how I can live in such a messy house (sigh), so I tend to dream about it from time to time, in the dream my house is always much messier then it REALLY is*. So I am freaking out, next thing I know there is a knock at my door, it's my mom and some friends of hers, I am like NO, you all need to turn around and walk out of here. They all did except my mom. She was standing there talking to me. Then I remember they left and I walked downstairs to meet them outside and suddenly my mom went into my condo. She had a key. My condo has a key to the BUILDING and then a key to my apartment. In the dream all my mom had was the building key yet for some reason I worked on my door as well and she was able to get in. This disturbed me and I remember thinking in my dream that it was time to change the locks. Next part of the dream. I am down the street at my friend Tammy's house waiting for her. Then I go outside for something, and then go back to her house, and as I am standing in front of her door this van drives by that says ""Disney World Police"" so I just kinda stand there til the pass, then I go inside, I yell ""Tammy?"" and an old woman looks up from the kitchen table saying I was at the wrong house. I realized Tammy was next door. I go out the back and run into some people, as I am walking around to the front of the house this kid starts walking with me. I asked him if he liked Peanut Butter, he says yes, I asked if he liked chocolate, he said yes, then I tell him that he would LOVE reeses peanut butter cups *ironically I had some before going to sleep*. The final part of the dream I am somewhere and I am trying to find my car, yet I can't remember if I had actually driven there or not and realize the car could potentially be at home, so I head home to fine out, then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(In real life I can't stand Dr. Drew. 1. he refers kids to abusive programs like Diamond Ranch Academy 2. His views on addiction are bunk). I walked up to him and told him I needed to talk with him. He said he was leaving but that I could ride with him. So we are in the car and I started asking him why he refers children to known abusive programs where children have died and been abused and tortured. I also talked about how many survivors had reached out to him and tried to contact him over the years. He stated he doesn't ever remember receiving any letters. He also claimed he was unaware of the torture and abuse and seemed genuinely surprised. We discussed a few other things and that was it. Once we got to his house, I left and walked back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5497,,,,,,,06-29-2001,"Ok this was a wild one. I am attending some school. Its' like a college I guess. I think i was there for music (thats what i went for in real life) but for some reason i ended up having to do ""fashion"" related classes. (the college i went to was the art institute it had music, fashion, art etc). We had to put on some fashion show. I really didn't want to be in it and remember arguing with some girl to that effect. I think I left and then I ran into some friends who were driving down the street. We went and got a drink and then went back to the fashion show. During one part of the dream, I threw water on a girl because she did something to piss me off, although I don't remember exactly when this occurred in the dream. Then I am sitting in our ""dorm"", it was more like a house that we all shared. A package came for some girl who we didn't know, so we opened it. It was like a care package, had things like lotion and candy etc. Then this girl walks up and asked why we had opened her package. I felt really bad and tried to come up with some explanation. She seemed a bit angry and I was worried she was going to report us or something. Later in the dream I got called into the office of the headmistress (who was really someone i used to work with in real life named Tyra). They kicked me out of the school for the water and package incident, as well as some other thing. So I came back home and moved in with my mom. I called Chyrise and told her about it. I told her the school was full of shit anyway they were only concerned with appearance and not learning. Then I am watching TV and I see Chyrise and this other girl in a canoe, next to this really big yacht and they start performing this song acapella. I was shocked because I realize she had joined the school I had just been kicked out of. I am really pissed at this point. Suddenly I am there where the boat is. I jump into the water so no one will see me, and I dive under, way under, until the boat passes. I was able to breath underwater, even though I didn't find that unusual. Finally I am ready to come back up and I begin to approach the surface, although it seems to take a good while. My head pops out of the water but instead I am looking out from under some sheets on a bed. I see someone standing over me and getting ready to hit me with a big 2 by 4, so I go back under. I had a feeling it was my mom. I come back up again and there is some kind of floatation device I am holding on to. Then I see a shark. I get a little scared. It comes up to me and tries to bite me. I am basically swimming backwards as I hold onto this float thing. As I face the shark to keep my eye on it. It keeps coming at me and I keep bopping it on the nose. I start looking for land. In the water there are all these trees but they are just sticking out of the wather, there is no actual land I can go to. Then the shark tries to come up on the side of me and he latches on to my left arm. Although I felt no pain, I somehow get him off my arm. Now I am out of the water and back at the school, I am there to find Chyrise. I go into the bathroom and she is there. I walk out and wait for her. I call her name and she comes over. I start crying and tell her I can't believe she did this to me by being a traitor and going to this school. I tell her i am moving to california in 3 months (we are really moving there one of these days). She askes if she can come and i say i dont know. she starts crying. Finally i leave and on the way out of the building i run into the headmistresses son. It was the actor Matthew Davis (if you dont know who he is, he's really cute). Anyway I guess he liked me because he saw me and gave me a big hug and we started to kiss. I felt very relieved, we just stood there and held eachother. He told me he knew his mom was full of shit and that I shouldnt have been kicked out. (at this point i wake up slightly, and was pissed because i hate waking up when i am with a really cute guy in my dream LOL, so i pretty much tell myself to keep the dream going, I guess it worked i must have fallen right back to sleep) Then we go to a hotel together. Someone else is rooming with us. We tell him he may want to get his own room. But then we realize he is safer staying with us so he stays. Then he says ""But im not having a twosome with you Kelly"". I assume he meant 3-some and I just laugh. Now bunch of us including Matthew are at my moms house. Some jeep pulls up and I walk out in just pants and a bra, I realize they are here to see matthew and walk back in and then I hear them laughing. It really bothers me. When matthew comes in we talk about california. He said he lived in Jackyville and it was extremely hot there and near the Atlantic. i got confused because I thought he meant Jacksonville (fl) and the Atlantic is not near Cali. So I asked again if he meant California. He didn't answer but someone else said yes it was. Then he explained the guys were laughing because as they pulled up they morphed in to someone else. Then we saw a playback video of how they morphed and the guys were girls in the video. It's kind of hard to explain. Now i am in some auditorium with Chyrise. not sure what it was for. Someone asked me if i played guitar and i said i was just learning. Then i see matthew across the auditorium, he is smiling at me. I stop smiling and he stops. I smile and he smiles. I see him lean over and kiss this girl I used to go to school with, named Susie, on the cheek. Then I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I remember I was lying on my side and it felt like I was going to fall out of the plane, I was hoping it would land before I fell. Now I'm in some school/job. There were cubicles. My friend Dave Anderson was in the dream. I had to use the rest room and found the public rest room. I waited until it cleared out and then went in.

5522,,,,,,,06-29-2001,"Ok first I am with some people and we are all talking. I remember seeing a clip of a movie and then I see one of the guys who was in the movie. In the movie he was rowing a boat and it looked really fake almost as if he were actually sitting still instead of moving in the boat. I asked him if it was filmed fake and he said yes. There was some other guy sitting near me and I remember splashing water on him. Now this part of the dream gets interesting. I called the bank and had some money transferred to another account. Then there was another thing that needed to be moved but it looks like it had been an error because it was the same amount and had the same id as the previous transaction or something like that. I tried to explain to the lady that we couldn't transfer it because it was a duplicate. She didn't seem to understand but I kept trying to explain. Finally I went and got a pen, now the lady is standing next to me. I write out the ID of 1 and the amount of $70. Then underneath I write the ID of 1 again and the amount of $70. I show her they are identical and that we can't have 2 records with the same ID, she finally understands. I am now at a store. I am standing in line to wait to pay for something, can't remember what i was going to buy but I notice someone had spilled some dirt on the counter and the lady pushed it aside. As I waited she passed around a plate of cookies. She was passing them to everyone but me. Finally she offered me one, I broke off a piece of a very yummie looking chocolate chip cookie. I remember eating the cookie and actually tasting it and it was good. Then as I wait to pay for my item I see some other cookies behind the counter that are for sale, but they look different then the ones I just tried. I consider buying some but change my mind. Now I hear a song by Ike Turner (it was one from the movie What's Love Got to do with It) that he sang near the beginning of the movie at a club. Anyway it's playing on the radio, and I can hear it distinctly. I look over behind the other counter and there are these 2 black guys that work there and they are singing along with the song. Then the phone rang and I woke up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I look to my left and see another plane (these are big commercial airliners) come really close to our plane. Then I feel it hit. I suddenly know we are going to crash. I can feel the plane shaking. I didn't time to get into my seat and put my seat belt on so I just curled up into a ball against the seat and waited for us to crash. We hit the ground and I am expecting all this stuff to come flying down the aisle from the impact but instead we land with no problem. We exit the plane into what appears to be a very small airport. They tell us they will bring the luggage to us. They start bringing the luggage out and they just pile it all up in the street. It's night time and quite dark out. I spot my peice of luggage and grab it. Then I spot a purse I recognize and grabbed that too so no one would steal it. As I am doing that some guy comes up and grabs someone else's purse and starts to walk off. I scream out ""Someone stop him!"" and this blonde guy grabs him and gets the purse. He hands it to me and we look inside to identify whose it was. It had some papers in it but not much else. The purse was kind of ugly and cream colored. I don't remember what happened to that purse. Now I had picked up a purse as well it was black and had some kind of insignia on it. I went up to my friend and asked her if it was hers. She said no but she thought it was so-and-so's. Don't remember the name. So I went up to that person and it was her purse so I gave it to her. Then there was some other girl there who I walked up to. I handed her a check for $200 and told her it was for something nice that she had done. I remember thinking in the dream that I couldn't wait to get home to tell everyone about this plane crash.

I am walking up to the shopping center where someone is supposed to pick me up. It was night time. As I was walking I ran into this man. He pointed to a building down the street and said something to the effect that it was going to be demolished and I better leave. Then I saw something that said it would affect anyone within a 11 mile radius. Next I am with some people in a car we are driving to a night club I beleive. I don't think we ever got to the club. Then I am in some house and some people are sleeping. We go out and start going to these stores. I was looking for a store that sold rare books and other rare items. I got to this one store and this older man come up to me. I told him I was looking for rare items and then pointed out my nose ring to him and told him I got it at another shop that sold rare items. The walked me over to a desk and opened the drawer and pulled out this peach colored nose stud. I looked at it and it was way to wide to fit me. Then he proceeded to show me how to wear it, it was as if it snapped over the one I already had on. He said that you didn't even have to have your nose pierced to wear it. I am back at this house and I woke up one person saying we should all go to breakfast. Then we are at some diner and people are ordering things. One guy ordered some cheese sticks or something. I reminded everyone not to eat much since we were going out to breakfast. LOL Then we left the diner and went somewhere else. Not sure where we were exactly, but it was outside and there were a lot of people walking around. I remember there was this big grassy hill. Then I see a cop and think to myself that they must be coming for me because i left the diner without paying. And of course the cop and one other guy walked up saying I hadn't paid. I was like ""Oh my god I am so sorry I didn't mean to leave without paying"" and paid them what I owed. That's all I really remember.

5554,,,,,,ID: km2015:km details,06-29-2001,"Ok last night I had a wild dream. There were all these different parts I will just mention what I remember, it doesn't flow too well because I am forgetting some things. Ok first I remember I was going to some costume party and I wanted to be the devil. But I couldn't find a devil mask. I looked all over my house and still couldn't find one. Finally my friend gave me a red cowboy hat I could wear, not quite the same as a devil mask but in the dream it seemed to satisfy me. Then I remember getting some tattoos on my lower arms and my hands (one place I probably wouldn't get tattoos, at least not my hands). I don't remember what the tattoos were, other than some weird design and some words. Then, I suddenly realized I had tattoos on my hand that were now there for life, and was a little unhappy about that. That's all I remember about that piece of the dream. Next, I remember being in control of this car. I wasn't actually in the car, I was above the car, up in the air, yet controlling it, either with a remote or my mind, I don't remember. Yet at the same time I must have been IN the car because I was worried about getting pulled over by the cops. Anyway since I had control of this car I made it drive down these residential streets at like 90 miles per hours, hitting a few things along the way, it was cool heh. Then I remember coming to this place, and there was this guy and his dog standing there, but they didn't see me, although I thought they did. I got concerned because I thought they were going to start following me. I started walking along this path and came to this little structure with all these statues. I sat on one of the statues and watched the people. The statues were of Female Basketball players. LOL The next part of the dream, I am driving in a car with some other people, we were on a mission to do something, but I can't remember what. We get to the post office and pull into the parking lot, which was flooded and empty. As soon as we pull in another car, which looked like it was full of hispanic people, pulled up. The girl in the back seat pulled out a gun and pointed it at us. Then I remember getting out of the car and being forced to the ground, in a bush no less. The gun was pointed (making contact with) the top of my head. I was scared shitless and shaking, can actually remember feeling it as if it were happening. Then suddenly a thought goes through my mind asking why I was scared. If I were shot I would die instantly and feel NO pain. I personally am not scared of DEATH, it's just the WAY in which I die that has me a little concerned. So I realized I had nothing to be afraid of, if it was my time, it was my time and I would go out painlessly. Then she moved the gun from the top of my head around to the back at the base of my head and neck. We were taken to this house. I knew, for some reason, that they were going to kill us, or at least the people I was with. I remember the people, who lived at that house, talking to me like nothing was wrong. They took one of the people I was with (who turned out to be someone that works with me in real life). At first it appeared as if they were going to cut his throat, but as weird as dreams are, they ended up giving him a tattoo right on his neck. 2 little symbols near his adams apple, OUCH. Then this black guy came up to me and asked me if I was bi-sexual. I don't remember what I said, and then he told me he was bi-sexual and walked away switching his ass like a girl would. Then I woke up. Talk about STRANGE!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5559,,,,,,ID: freya_series_1:freya details,07-13-1981,"1. “Don’t Be Afraid” I have just arrived to Prague in Czechoslovakia and I’m together with another person – I think it’s a woman. And we are on our way in a car to the hotel. The road is rather winding and hilly and we are driving over bridges. Under the bridges, there are rivers with a rather strong current. Somewhere in the distance I can see cars that are driving on roads where there is water – there is water on the roads. There seems to have been some flooding from the river. It scares me a little but I soon forget it. Then we come to a kind of tunnel with water in it. Here we have to put off the motor and set the car in a neutral gear and close doors and windows. And then the river takes us and the car away with the current. And at a certain time, the wheels in the car are turning upside down. For me it’s both scary and exciting. Then we come out of the water tunnel again and the car is now driving in a normal way. We are now on a very, very big open square. The earth is some base color flax with small round spots. It could be some kind of marble. We are very excited and in high spirits and very relieved after this trip in the water tunnel and we are eating some food with a very happy feeling. The food seems to be some celery or corn or salad or things like that. While we are eating, we are looking out on this big square. The sun is shining now. Until now I have been with this other person but I never see the person in the dream. I just have a feeling it’s a woman. Now I’m alone at the hotel where there seems to be some problems with my room. After some time, a lady comes and takes me to room 35. This room seems to be a kind of gymnastic room with some wall hangings on the walls. Now some people try to make this room nice to stay in. They put in some shelves and some commercial stuff from a hairdresser/salon room. But now I tell this lady who showed me the room and now she is about forty and small and a little fat. I tell her that I really wouldn’t like to stay in that room. One of the reasons is that there are no windows. She tells me that she thought it was room number 34 I should have and not 35. Now I go down to the reception and I have some kind of a power struggle with a man at the reception. I tell him that I want another room. He tells me that I can’t have that – they don’t have other rooms. But I stick to my view and after some time I tell him that if he doesn’t give me another room with windows, I will write a letter to the Danish government when I come home and tell how I have been treated. Now he becomes insecure and he looks as if he’s starting to cry. He says, “just a moment,” and then he walks into another room. Soon after he comes back and he gives me some keys to the room 68. I think it’s number 98 because in the dream, 98 seems to be the opposite of 68, but of course if you take the 6-8 and you turn it around it’s 8-6, so it’s 86. But never mind I have another room and everything is okay. In the dream I’m very surprised that I can find my way around at the hotel because in real life I’m really bad at that – I very easily get lost in streets and hotels and things like that. So, but in the dream it’s okay. Now I’m walking in Prague together with the lady from the hotel - the one who showed me the room 35 – and another lady I know, a former neighbor, a woman. We walk around in the town where there are no cars. The houses are beautiful white with blue turquoise ornaments and there are street entertainers who are dancing in a long row, holding each other’s hands and their faces are turned towards us. The lady from the hotel tells me that it has something to do with a newly built museum. I say that these street entertainers, I would really like to show them to my son. In the background we can see some spears and we can hear some gorillas – some sounds from the churches. And then suddenly we are walking on a gravel road (I think it is like the roads you have in mountains) and in these mountains there are a lot of heather - red violet blooming heather. I say that it’s fantastic that you can find this kind of gravel roads (I think it’s called) in a big city. While we are walking on this gravel roads in the mountain there are some geese running after us - like when I was a child and went through a farm on my way to school there was always some geese that ran after me and I was quite afraid of them at that time. Now in the dream I start running but I’m just a little afraid. Now we come to the end of the mountain where the mountain stops. The view is beautiful. You can see a lot of hills and mountains all covered with heather, this red violet color. The people I’m together with walk to the edge of our mountain and look down. I look down too, but it’s a sort of precipice, I think it is - they are far down and suddenly you just look down, so I get scared and I have to lie down in the heather. I don’t want to show the other people that I am afraid. On some other hills and mountains you can see people are having fun tumbling down these slopes and they are really having fun. But, I’m just lying in the heather and looking at it and I’m not showing that I’m actually afraid. The slope or precipice - there where the mountain ends and you look down is different at the mountain I’m at because it sort of goes out and then it goes in and so if you fall down here you don’t tumble down, you just fall down. And the other mountains I’m looking at it, there you can sort of roll down or fall down, not suddenly but smoothly. [at home]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It could be silk. Blood was dripping from the ceiling and I got a little anxious about that and got hold of a guy who was director in the company where I work and he’s a very factual guy. So I showed him the ceiling, and he said it’s okay there is dripping blood down from the ceiling. And then I started looking down into another room or perhaps another world. The atmosphere was something with planets being created and destroyed, and there were earthquakes, landslips, floods, very big forces. There were fire, water and enormous power. Suddenly I saw that it was my father who was dissolving or disintegrating. I showed this to my husband, Bruce. And then I’m at some kind of a theatre where somebody is very keen on making some kind of play or musical. The musical or the play should be some people some groups in turquoise and white clothes and sort of looking a bit like a carnival and they should be dancing and hopping around. I find this extremely artificial and superficial, but somehow I feel I have to be a part of it as it could have unpleasant consequences for other people if I don’t want to join this happening, or whatever it is. It’s very unpleasant for me, as I find the theatre and the play very empty – it’s a delusion, I feel. When the play is over, we get some raisins and something they called stardust. And now my husband Bruce and I are walking along a road where there is a lot of weekend traffic. I walk behind Bruce and I’m leaning on him and crying. I say that I don’t want to be a part of this theatre or I don’t want to use this stardust. I don’t want to be a part of something that’s not real here on Earth. It has to be grounded. It has to be real. Then we meet a couple we know and the lady tells me that she agrees with me. She’s a very grounded woman with four children. Bruce is very uncomfortable too and doesn’t want to have anything to do with this stardust. [Edinburgh after three weeks vacation in the USA]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5561,,,,,,ID: freya_series_1:freya details,07-13-1981,"8. There’s a big guy and there’s an association in the dream to John Wayne. Ann saw his film, Red River, the night before. And this John Wayne guy has captured Ann’s old school, in the small village where she grew up. (Now I’ll say “I” because I’m in the dream now.) I’m together with a very unusual wonderful handsome clever girl. She’s about 11-12 years old. But sometimes she’s younger because I’m carrying her in my arms in some parts of the dreams. Everybody, all people in the whole world, agree that this girl is a very special child filled with love, calm and warmth. Everybody thinks that her wonderful soul or whatever you would call it, her essence, has to do with the fact that her mother was blindfolded. In the dream, this English word, “blindfolded” comes up. The mother lives at a big farm, a farm that Bruce and I visited at some time. I can see the kitchen very clearly and I remember precisely how it looked at the farm and how the atmosphere was. There was a lot of room, but it was all a bit dark, perhaps a bit lonesome, too. I see the contour of the mother. She looks like the women, the farmer wives, I knew as a child. I’m trying to convince the John Wayne guy that he should open the school and let people come in – the people come up to the school – because the school is on a hill as it was in real life. Then you can see a lot of people standing on a road. The John Wayne guy that has no guns or other means to keep people out, he’s sort of keeping them out with his stubbornness. He is rather stubborn and he doesn’t speak much, again like the John Wayne in the film. I love this guy very much, but it’s not an erotic atmosphere. My feelings for this man are deeper than being in love. It’s more like between children and parents, or between siblings. The connection is, it’s just there. Suddenly people start to walk up the hill where the school is. They are in party dress and they are coming with presents and they bring flowers, too. The first guy who comes is a psychiatrist I know. He’s very, very elegant dressed black and white with a hat and a red rose in his jacket. He has a big smile, but he’s rather shy. I’m leaning on the John Wayne guy and I feel very, very happy. For a very long time I can see the girl’s face before me - she’s slim, she’s dark haired and she has warm brown eyes. The school and the village where the dream is happening is the place where I grew up as an adopted child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are sitting up in a helicopter or a small airplane. At a certain time there seems to be another guy near the cockpit and I ask the instructor if he, the other guy, is a pilot. The instructor says no. Then there is an erotic atmosphere between me and the instructor, and I feel a bit insecure – is this suitable for a man like him and for me? But I really enjoy it – the connection with him. At the same time I think that I have to get it out of my head and go down and sit down in the hall somewhere on a chair, but now it actually seems as if this is a meeting outdoors. Well, anyhow, I have to keep my feelings low, and think that I could probably just give him my address. I have no doubt about what I want to do, but I’m insecure about the way he lives – how he lives – and if more contact with me will give him problems in some way because he’s this meditation instructor. He doesn’t worry at all. He’s very relaxed and he’s having his hand on my back and it’s a very close contact we have. Then things change and now I’m at work, and this is a day where two new colleagues started work and I should actually be at my office and say welcome to them. But for some reason I have been very busy and been away and now in the middle of the daytime I’m sitting one afternoon in a park. It’s a park with lakes like you would see in Rome or Copenhagen or other cities – Paris, too. In the park there’s an older coupe with a child. There’s a very easy going relaxed atmosphere and everybody has plenty of time. Suddenly we see a very big mulatto girl – very brown, sensual soft and powerful. And she comes flying. She flies very, very fast. And some small birds and big birds, too, are following after her and sort of sniff to her genitals in a way like flies can do if you lie there without clothes. She’s sort of just whisking them away with her hand once in a while. And then she’s flying as if she was just lying on her stomach and I say to the – I think it’s the man in this older couple - that I have heard that you can fly in this way, but I have never known that you actually could fly in this way. It’s an incredible sight and we agree on that. We are very surprised. So, later on I’m also in the park, but now it’s evening, as it is dark. I’m sitting on – people are sitting on the benches – and I’m a little insecure about finding my way home. And then suddenly I’m back in my office room and very friendly I say hello to the two colleagues and say I hope they will excuse that I have been away. And then we eat lunch together with the other people who are working in this office.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many houses which are big and made of wood. The people are friendly. I am a guest, renting a room. A block away a tree catches fire. A fierce wind whips the fire out of control. At one point the entire sky is whitened by heat and flame and it appears the house which contains my belongings will ignite. No one panics. I rush into the house to recover my back pack. I am confused. Which room is mine? My things have been moved. I find them in another room. It is large and half open to the elements. On the way out I watch a good-looking middle aged woman undress. It is very erotic. Outside, things are calm. I meet a young man who is a veterinarian. He has a dog which has sustained burns to its back. The dog appears aware of its injury but remains feisty. Somewhat humorously I say to the doctor, ""So, you have casualties."" I cannot recall his exact words but he is optimistic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5567,,,,,,,,"031 Half awake in the dream, I am in some sort of open foxhole. I look to my left and see two VC sappers crawling past. They have mortars and are dropping them on a position ahead of me. I know that I have to move slowly and then spring up and kill them (they are almost on top of me). The friendly position is in front of me. I kill one fellow (VC). The other fellow manages to break free and begins talking into a small radio. He seems to be an FO [Forward Observer]. He talks quickly, as if sensing he is to die soon. We grapple and he manages to stab me a few times. Then he too is dead. Just as this happens, something amazing occurs. The whole countryside goes up in fire. A gigantic conflagration, in twenty seconds hundreds and hundreds of yards of land are on fire. For a few moments I don't know if I've done something good or bad. All I know is that to survive I must jump into the water. It seems that I am right near the ocean. I swim forward, trying to beat the land which is also racing forward. Then, at one point, there seems a sort of monster or demon that chases me. It too is on fire but submerged underwater. From behind me a friendly force fires a weapon and kills the monster. At once all the other fire in the dream ceases. Then the dream becomes vague. I seem to be greeted by friends, friendly voices. I am facing East in the dream-the sappers are facing East. I myself seem to be out on a mission, away from a main base. The sappers come from behind; the friendly forces are in front (the same position fired on above). I am saved when the monster dies and I seem to have made contact again with friendly forces. I am welcomed back.

Above the tall trees a commercial plane veers low and loud; the left wing hits the top of tree branches and ignites; the plane spins and tumbles in the air, then crashes. I am directly in its path and move away just in time to avoid being killed by large pieces of bouncing wreckage. A capsule like pod nearly crushes me, but I manage to avoid it. The capsule is on fire and the pilots inside are trapped. The escape hatches are fiery hot but from within or with my help they are opened.

We are on high ground, overlooking a huge river. Between the three of us there is only one magazine of ammunition. Moments before, I had the opportunity to get more, but I did not take it. We are waiting, anticipating an ambush. Two Chinese come up the hill on horseback. One dismounts and comes right up to the open ports of the shelter. He has a samurai sword. I lunge my M -16 into his chest and pull the trigger. The sound is not the usual sharp staccato that I am used to. Instead, it is muffled and somewhat dull.

I become serious and tell him to keep his voice down and find the matches. At the same time I am aware that something is out of place. The water is not deep. Suddenly we are charged from our right flank. A group of ten or fifteen men with fixed bayonets sallies towards us. They appear to be Oriental, though at the last moment I see that it is all a sham. These are our own men. I have been the object of a great joke. Rolling on the ground, David and I howl with laughter. We begin to sing a popular song.

In a large field several teenage soldiers explode a device that releases a smoky fog. It appears to be toxic. At detonation I am hit by its shrapnel. I feel the cardboard splinters penetrate my back, though they do me no real harm. We march back to our starting point.

The RTO speaks without having to break squelch. Apparently the radio operates by voice recognition. He is frightened, trying to locate the other troops, since they are not to be seen. I need more ammo and cannot find it. I am high up in a tree with two small children. Opposite us we watch a mother bird feed her young. She flees at the approach of a giant rat. He enters the nest and scavenges for food. He slithers down, the dead body of an animal hanging from his mouth. The rat then begins climbing up the tree. The children are frightened. My plan is to let it crawl up to our height, then punch the glass collar though which it must pass to reach us. When the rat’s head is beneath the glass I begin punching. I disregard the possible damage to my fist. The glass breaks, blood streams down the tree from the rat’s smashed head. The rat falls away and dies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each side is firing artillery, adjusting for accuracy. The shells fly back and forth and fall with muffled dull thuds. Then the other side launches a ground attack. They throw hand grenades as they run. The grenades hit the ground and bounce forward. I catch one and hurl it back. Then another, then two more. The others (other side?) do the same. I am in hand to hand combat with a man of about fifty; he is fat and ruddy looking. With a sinister leer he taunts me. Twisting his knife through the air he is easily the more skillful.

I hug the earth and cannot recall being hurt. Next, the dink gunner rolls a base ball grenade towards me. I consider my chances against the time delay, grab it and hurl it a mighty length. It explodes harmlessly in the air. The duel renews. His bullets churn up staccato patterns of dust in front of me. I fire one long burst and catch him with one shot in the chest. He is dead.

As usual we are spread apart, perhaps 4 to 5 meters between each man. The foliage ahead grows less and less dense.; one can see 25· to 30 meters forward, it is somewhat like the better terrain we encountered in Tay Ninh. I anticipate an ambush; things are going too easily. Beyond the stillness of our own guarded movements I sense another. With the first starting shots I drop instinctively to the ground. These are not the familiar popping sounds of the AK, though nonetheless I have anticipated correctly, we are in contact. Those up front fire back, immediately killing two. Then from my position I see two or three heads begin to rise. I yell to the others, at the same time pointing the muzzle of my 16 in the enemy's direction and attempting to fire. The gun jams. Quickly I reload another magazine and pull the trigger. Again nothing, but the others have caught on and the enemy attack seems over. From the background I hear a sharp whining recoil; it is nothing like our 105s or 155s. The number 106 flashes through my mind, though I am not sure if there is such a weapon; perhaps light weapons, but as the shells fall I realize they are undoubtedly heavy artillery. The first explosions fall outside our perimeter; they do not descend like mortars, nor do they explode like artillery. On impact there is a sharp thunder-clap, followed by earth-like clouds of swirling, thick and heavy dust; though it is curious, these manifestations are small and hug the ground. Soon the shells drop closer and' closer to us, and I hear the shrapnel whizzing over. Finally one lands almost on top of me and I imagine a large piece of steel penetrating the flesh of my back. There is no pain, but I realize this to be a death wound. The last moments of the dream are obscured by the dust clouds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5591,,,,,Male,ID: mike_journal:mike details,06-28-1970,"057 In Vietnam, as a witness, I view war at close range. The first thing I see in the crowded street is an AK-47, stuck into a wall by its bayonet. There are angry words written on its stock, but I cannot remember them. All around, Vietnamese men are frantically fighting, shooting back over a wall or barrier. I am lying on the top of a bunk bed, sorting through the belongings of someone. This person, apparently dead, had collected stamps. Paging through a small album, I see many American air mail stamps I recall from my youth. Suddenly a man nearby is shot and falls. I see the bullets kick and sting the dirt near him. Two nurses, wearing red and white striped dresses, come to his aid. They are completely vulnerable, turning their backs to the enemy. I am amazed at their bravery or foolishness. One nurse in particular attends to the man, who is mortally wounded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5592,,,,,,,,"080 Dream 1: In the dream I am at war. The terrain is rocky and dry. We are being mortared. The shells fall close. A nearby man who much resembles Ray of the CP [Command Platoon] is struck by the blast of a near direct hit and killed instantly, though his body seizes up, as if he were struck dumb. There is no blood or sign of injury. A second man is killed in likewise manner. No one moves. I run for cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5593,,,,,Male,ID: mike_journal:mike details,06-28-1970,"046 I am with someone else. We are in Vietnam, walking through swamp and terrain bordering a river. It is the present, not the past. We are lost. We pass an American who holds up a strand of fishing line with a lure attached to it. He says, ""This came all the way from TEXAS."" We continue walking. I say, ""We're supposed to be going to An Loc or Loc Ninh. I take the lead, follow a path, a well-used trail, and emerge in a clearing. It is clean and well-tended; I am reminded of Maplewood Park. Recollection ends here. I am in a trench in charge of an M-60 or a SAW machine gun. Opposite me, less than ten yards away, in another trench, are several Americans. Lt. Sharp tells me to fire on them. I don't want to kill them. Waking up from the dream I am half shouting, ""Get down.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It ends by telling how men, when desperate for cover, would dive down in the latrine area, only to be stained with shit. Just as I read this my hand is fouled by human waste streaked on the ground. I wash it off in a large pool of fresh clear water. The dog swims in the water. She is happy, though somewhat nervous and high-strung, as was her nature. We continue walking and arrive at a wealthy residential area. It is safe and quiet and there is much greenery. I wear blue jeans and walk with much confidence. The dog, as was her way, romps and sprints ahead. We arrive at a store which is closed. The dog jumps up on a small landing. I pet her and she places her arm on mine and nuzzles me. There is a profoundly strong and shared sense of happiness and well-being. In fact, the sense of love is the deepest I have felt in a long, long time. Then a young married couple oogle and awe and pet the dog and the spell is broken. We continue walking and it is good, but the intense feeling of love is lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5595,,,,,Male,ID: mike_journal:mike details,06-28-1970,"016 I am with a friend. We have traveled to a strange land. The people resemble the “pineys” of the Pine Barrens (in New Jersey). They are very kind and friendly; they share food and drink with us. I am easily at home with them. They present me with many small gifts. I am perched up on a high ledge. An old college English teacher is to read one of David Boyle's poems. He (David) asks that he may read it himself It is written in a very simple hieroglyphic form. There are crows and hawks and their feet markings: [drawing]. As he reads I become emotionally aroused. Moments later I am openly weeping. I return to this land with my old platoon. Everything has changed. The land has been scorched; nothing remains from the joyous past. I begin to load my M-16 but it is with the new and unfamiliar banana clip. We are ambushed. I squeeze off a few rounds before scampering for cover. I lose sight of my platoon. They patrol without me, the only medic. A sense of great overwhelming guilt follows. We relink later. I am ashamed of myself, but I am glad to see that the others are all safe. The Lieutenant is somewhat stern with me. The shame passes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5596,,,,,Male,ID: mike_journal:mike details,06-28-1970,"011 We are on the same fire base as the one established in Cambodia. This time I am not with my own platoon but I am part of the TOC/CP. BC (?) Is none other than the young doctor from LZ Green who did not know how to handle his own rank. We meddle about in a huge canvas tent. I think about digging a fox hole but there are no shovels. Night comes. All of a sudden there is a metallic burst of illumination flares. The sky lights up and we are showered by the magnesium brightness. For the first few moments no one knows what is going on. Who has called for the lume? Then, through the thin canvas I see two figures run past about 40 yards off. So, it is a ground attack. But I say nothing. Moments later the AK's open up. In the dream there are several old house where the gooks have holed up. My old platoon and I converge on it. With my M-16 roaring I cut down several dinks. I am overwhelmed by the sight of two individuals fighting with the enemy. Of all people, there is Wilson, our old RTO. I begin to fire, but my M-16 is sluggish; the bullets dumbly chug out. Wilson is followed by Juba, my friend from down the street, a high school buddy (who now I go to bars with every now and then). Juba has a long .45. His long drilling shots come after Wilson sprays me with a burst that catches me flush across the body. Again, though I am obviously hit, nothing happens. The fire fight ends. We go back to the tent. I see bullet holes in my ankles. The Captain asks me if there is anything I want. I think of telling him, ""Yes! A Medivac,"" but I say only that we should dig fox holes. The next day I scrounge for ammo. There is little or none to be found, though I steal two grenades. I meet Roop and Melhop. During the fire fight, I use grenades but they prove ineffective. Even though I hold them for two or three seconds after the handle flies off (and they hiss like smoke grenades) they are thrown too hard and bounce away, and oddly, explode in a mere crackle of sparks, the way smoke does when it first ignites. Steve Shack (a fellow from sleep away camp) and I go to the other side of the base. There is a small VN compound. Shack throws a grenade into a little wooden school house filled with children. It blows up and there are the horrific screams of the wounded. We walk down a trail. I am telling him how stupid he is for making this mess, surely there will be another attack tonight. Children come shrieking out and run after us. I turn and beckon to them. ""Come with me, come to me."" A jeep pulls up and takes on the casualties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I open one and throw it. It explodes. Then we see my father in the distance. He beckons to us. As we go, I hurl missiles in his direction. They are like giant bullets, arching up, then falling and crashing down. We speak to him about flowers. He insists that cultivation (gardening) is no different from nature. My brother and I argue against my father. The scene changes. Looking out a window I can see I am very high off the ground. A man below is reading off winning numbers from some sort of lottery. Thousands of people are gathering. He has somehow angered them. I fall out the window but somehow survive the fall. Then a huge oblong plate of metal tumbles down and strikes me a glancing blow on the head. I think it is a death blow, as I am weak from loss of blood. I am weeping. My mother tries to comfort me. In between my sobbing I tell her to contact Peter Ahr (giving his correct address) and with this message say, ""Tell David [David Boyle] I'm sorry."" Then, as it appears that the wound is not mortal, I suggest we go and get an x-ray.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Either the low altitude, or the jungle canopy or both provide for a soft landing and very little damage, though it appears my co-pilot is slightly injured. There are only three or four grunts on board. I give them an order to form a perimeter. They do not obey. This becomes the basic tension of the dream: Am I or am I not in control? It would appear that I am not. We are spotted by some friendly civilians and again my orders are not obeyed. This happens a second time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all are lame, but march to the aid station in the cold, hard snow. They overwhelm the staff who make complaints against them. I am sad because no one cares, no one understands how we suffer. A kind, middle-aged black medic tells me that Timmy Day, whose bad feet should have kept him out of the Army, will go home. But when I speak to Timmy Day, he says he has been denied sick call. He has seen no one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just as I spot this Clopton comes running past, dressed in white. He has been wounded in the arm. We gather about and form a defensive perimeter. A machine gun team of dinks stalks right up to us. It seems everyone is too scared to fire. I open up with three short bursts and literally rip the dink gunner in half. A while later, a single dink walks up to us, unmolested. I sense that no one is going to fire and spatter him wickedly with my M-16. It is a good feeling, though I am worried about ammo. We retreat to a large building and cluster fuck within. It seems almost like the room I am living in now. Several of us flop onto the bed and crash. I recall thinking about pulling guard twice a night. It is a wonder that we get enough sleep. I am tempted to doze off but the fear of dinks breaking in prompts me to stay awake. Someone has the side door covered. I shift about, watching one door and then the next, expecting an attack any second. The dream becomes unclear at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is war. I am hit with shrapnel in the back. Bao Ninh tends to me in hospital. He is clearly in charge of himself and the matter at hand. Like a Zen master he is deliberate and clear in all he does. I complain and grow anxious, become uncooperative. Bao Ninh ignores or engages me depending on my awareness of what is correct. At one point he appears to give up, though recollection is unclear. I wake up still much moved by the force of his personality.

We sleep in canvas tents, which I conscientiously view as rather odd. The enemy is undoubtedly oriental, and it is at this point that I detach myself from my own person and either become another, or simply phase out and watch what follows, experiencing the drama vicariously, twofold it would seem, as this is all imagined. The enemy attacks and I become acutely aware of the feeling of being shot in the head. I am behind a wall of some kind, the danger of being hit is very great. In a fury I grab a silver object which seems to resemble an rpg, and hurl it towards the foes. It explodes and immediately the entire area is shrouded in flames, even I (or the person I am watching) is/am enveloped. This is how the dream ends. I awaken with the all-too-familiar feeling that I notice each time I have a dream that ends with my own death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the dream we are being overrun by sappers who have got past the Night Defensive Perimeter trips and claymores and now crawl forward. I wake up and see a boot tread close to my face. I slowly withdraw my .45 from its holster, pull the hammer back, then aim it at the boot. Just then the cloud-obscured moon comes out and I realize the boot is American and that it is Jerry Bieck's foot. In the pitch stillness I point the .45 straight up in the air. Pinching the hammer tightly I pull the trigger and settle the hammer back in place. I re-holster the pistol and go back to sleep. The next day, after a very difficult march, all the men are overjoyed to be out of Cambodia. I tell no one what almost happened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She points and says, ""By the woman with the child."" I run in the direction she has pointed to. There is no one. The same woman appears. She is sitting at a table. She gives me three letters. They are addressed to me and contain official or important documents. The letters have been opened-searched. I go back to the snowy field. A man and a woman lumber towards me. The man comes up close and suddenly points a long object at me. It appears to be a stick. I hesitate. He shoots. I fall and feel blood flooding my chest. I feel the life force going out of me.

He tells me a plane has crashed over an airport and that all flights have been canceled. Next, I look up and see many helicopters, as though there is an enormous combat assault taking place. I board a small Loach after it appears it is not taking passengers. I am now loaded with combat gear. We fly in part of the combat assault formation and land on a base. There is no combat but it is unclear when and where we should go. An Asian man directs me down steps to an empty high school lab. I throw down my gear and try to sleep on a lawn outside. I am woken by a solider tugging my arm. He is upset over something I have caused. It is not serious and the solider is not angry, only concerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the flare went off the mines blew. With third platoon I rushed up to watch as the men picked off the enemy soldiers. Their legs were blown off. They screamed to each other, firing their AK's wildly. I knelt and wept at the slaughter. Afterwards, we scavenged the bodies for souvenirs and did not bury the corpses. Mike Wilson put a live frag with a smoke grenade fuse under the bodies. We moved out. Fifteen or twenty minutes later we heard the grenade explode; other NY A had been killed by the booby trap. 1 am in a familiar house but cannot name it. My brother and I are young. He throws a heavy silver ring at me. I go to chase him but he hides and disappears. I go to a bedroom and look under the bed, but there is only a rumpled blanket. Then to the bathroom, where I see him through the frosted windows. My brother says, ""I guess 1 should come out."" I agree, and confront him with the ring, which I have found. ""If you ever treat me with disrespect again I'll kill you,"" I tell him sternly. I am boiling with anger. Next, we are out in the open in a desert-like setting. My brother questions if I mean what I have said. I am on edge and angry and seek an excuse to be violent. My brother says, ""You wouldn't shoot me."" I tell him to be quiet, not to test me.

Another declares without his doctor he would have died but has lived an extra two years. The ward is home-like. The doctors are friendly. Each has his own cure; some succeed, others do not. My doctor is female. She is dedicated and loving. A staff member and I reach a doctor’s office at the same time. I push the door open. It is immediately slammed shut, catching my finger. The staff member knocks and is let in. I leave, aware that protocol must be obeyed. I become frustrated and rebel. For punishment I am sent to a large forest to gather pine needles in long neat rows. After several hours on my hands and knees, I try to escape. Using a dog, my doctor captures me. I quit the ward. In her presence I get dressed. I will be traveling heavy since there are my two traveler’s backpacks. I have a toothbrush too small for my mouth. My doctor tries to discourage me, but I am angry and sad.

They are chasing the enemy. Then I am part of this platoon and the terrain has changed from a hill covered by thick bush to a long slope covered by short grass. There is bamboo on either side. We begin to take incoming rockets. I hear the initial whoosh, followed by the thud and crash. Then the rockets come closer, and it is clear they are aiming at me. They are walking them in like mortars, not vertically, but horizontally, missing me by a few meters at most, and I must anticipate the next rocket by moving correctly either to the left or right or I will be killed. It is like a child’s game. I am trapped out in the open, running back and forth every few seconds, completely focused on what is taking place. I am not scared, but then I see the enemy behind foliage and a wire fence, launching the rockets, which in fact whiz past me like huge .22 caliber bullets. I see my brother, as if he were young, and I yell to him, yell loud and with anger, “Get my 16 and ammo, get my 16 and ammo.” Instead of running to help me, he simply walks toward where my things are. I yell again, dodging and side stepping rockets, but he continues to plod along, and I am angry at him, because he is acting like this is a joke.
