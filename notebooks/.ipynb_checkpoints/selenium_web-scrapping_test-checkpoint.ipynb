(The baseball bat had image had also appeared a couple of nights before, too).Later, at a restaurant, younger brother, D., as a child, was upset over losing a game to X.

I’ve decided to take a bus to the coast on my own. G was occupied and so I thought it would be nice to go by myself. I look at the beach and the </span><mark class=\" \">ocean</mark><span class=\"\"> from my bus window and know I’ve made the right choice. When I get there, I feel hungry and go to an underground market where there are several food vendors. Most of it is pizza. I receive a phone call and answer it. It is a doctor, and he tells me that he has unfortunate news about my parents. I ask him to elaborate and he says that they had died in Kansas. I think that not only is there no reason for my parents to be in Kansas, but they wouldn’t even be there together. I tell him he must have the wrong number and hang up. I pace around the stalls, thinking about the conversation, and the vendors think I’m about to order food, which I don’t. My sister calls and I tell her about this strange conversation. I see on my phone that her number is in Kansas so I think that maybe the doctor was right after all and my parents really had died there. I am then outside, walking towards a small lonely building that looks a bit like a </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> tower. I go through the door and see great pools of dark </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> with shadows moving beneath the surface. Someone I know is in there, but they jump into the </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> and sink below, expecting me to get them. I am afraid because I know strange creatures are in there but muster up enough courage to dive in. It is dark as night in the </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> and I reach out for my friend, who in my mind looks like a green tentacle, and try not to be frightened by the giant sharks I see coming towards me. One of them gets close and I close my eyes and imagine that I’ve risen to the surface. I am then out of the </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\">. I am then in a small market. I want to buy cereal but the only box has already been opened and has some toddler toys stuck in it. A girl is working there and I find out that her mother, which is my aunt, has died. I feel bad for her and vaguely remember something about my parents having a similar fate.

I am in a very tall building in a Brooklyn-sequel neighborhood. I run into Ben Berry (an old band mate I haven\\'t seen for years). I am surprised at first, but I\\'m so happy and excited to see him that I just give him a hug and don\\'t think on it further. We decide to jam together. My horn is acting sounding strange, but I keep playing because I\\'m having fun. The </span><mark class=\" \">fire</mark><span class=\"\"> alarm goes off and because we\\'re on one of the top floors, we are advised to exit to the roof. This dream logic satisfied me so I went up with my saxophone. As we were climbing the stairs, Liam (a close friend) brought his drone and I started to see the dream through the lens of the drone. Once on the roof everything became a big party/festival. There were food trucks and bars and stages for bands - it was a lot of fun, but got sloppy quickly. Somehow in all the fun/madness I lost track of where Sarah (my fiancé) ended up. I didn\\'t have a phone and so I just wandered. I ran into Ben again who said he was hungry. I said I would get food with him, so we took his motorcycle (I don\\'t think he has one in waking life) to a burger joint after climbing down the </span><mark class=\" \">fire</mark><span class=\"\"> escape. We then climbed back up once we had our burgers. Towards the end of the dream I had a very sudden sensation of fear. I heard screams from below and remembered that the building was on </span><mark class=\" \">fire</mark><span class=\"\"> a while ago. Jumping to conclusions, I decided the screams were coming from people below us and I decided that the building was collapsing. (I say \"I decided\" because at this point it was somewhat clear to me that my thoughts were creating the dream reality - even though this wasn\\'t the outcome I wanted, my dream logic dictated how the end of the dream should play out.)  As the building was falling I began having simultaneous experiences of different people on the roof/ people in the building/people falling from the building/people in helicopters around the building - as well as alternate endings to the dream. I then woke up slightly confused and had thoughts of 9-11. I didn\\'t had a connection to anyone in the attacks, nor have I thought much about 9-11 in the past several years, but it was a very emotional ending to the dream. And I\\'m not certain, but I think I was able to enter back into the dream and pick up where I was looking for Sarah and had an alternate ending where I found her and we partied and got rescued - but there was a James Bond element to it...That part is a bit fuzzy.</span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>hurd2015_post:jazz</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>05-26-2018</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>474</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/5d3ecf01-4ef7-4c0c-bfe7-33720f96e2f9/9d4e4e66-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Most Recent Dream</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">3.

Suddenly, Jaime invites a woman to get into our bed. There´s nothing sexual involved in the invitation but I feel so angry that begin to shout them. Jaime laughs, he says she is his cousin from Paraguay (he has no such a cousin). I then decide to break our partnership. Clients and students ask me not to do that. They tell me two words, in french. I can´t remember them but I know they´re important. Then I am in another scene, talking to a doctor. I´m not in a session with him, only talking. He tells me \"you´re angry with your allergy, that´s why you never get over it\". I see a dead piece of meat. I know it´s from my belly. My daughters and I touch it with sticks. I understand something is bad with me. I wake up.</span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>hurd2015_post:mitakuye</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>05-26-2018</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>245</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/b6df63ca-8160-4c02-b686-67581021e80e/9d4e3996-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Most Recent Dream</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">2.The big old house was being remodeled.

I went up and she was lying in bed in the redone bedroom.  The ceiling had been covered with some patterned, clear flower decorations.  It was a little overdone, but interesting.  There was an opaque glass sliding door.  I went over and opened it to see if there was a balcony.  There really wasn’t.  It was just a sloped roof with no rail.  A child crawled out, but we/I pulled her back in because it wasn’t suitable for a child.

I tried to look at the side of the building, too.   Up on the rooftop, I looked around to see the surrounding area.  The owner wanted to tear down some shacks visible in the backyard.

I have a sensation of triumph for having overcome the paralysis with dignity. I look for a window, and fly through it. The feeling of euphoria is maintained. On the other side there is a large garden, as of the nineteenth century, with aviaries and black iron gazebos, gravel roads and huge trees. I begin to cross it when a male character on a tiny motorcycle passes close to me. In the back he carry a dog. I ask him to take me in a tour through the garden. The dog gets down the motorcycle and I get in. I look to the place where the motorcycle came and I see other dogs and rabbits. They are waving to me. I feel a joy fun but the main traits of the garden have disappeared. Now it has walls made of small orange </span><mark class=\" \">stones</mark><span class=\"\"> orange (like polished pebbles). The character in the motorcycle takes me to the end of the garden.  These walls seem an insurmountable limit but the bike climbs the wall at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to our previous position. When passing the other side we are on a terrace.

I\\'m floating on a street that looks familiar (I guess it\\'s near my mother\\'s house). It\\'s night. Suddenly I realize that all my lucid dreams have night scenarios so I decide to try if I can change that at will (I have changed other aspects of a dream but not this). At first I find it hard, but I remember that I should relax and just imagine what I want. Finally I make it. Now it is day (although I do not see the </span><mark class=\" \">sun</mark><span class=\"\">). I fly up to the treetops, deciding what to do next. I can not decide it (this is very usual in my lucid dreams: too much to do, I don´t know what to do first and at the end I do very little).  Finally I reach the Plaza de Mayo (a famous square at the capital city of my country, it is the place where the house of government is, and most public events are held). Apparently, it´s uninhabited. No cars, bus or people. I turned round a corner (always floating over) and I see a little man walking. It\\'s like a person but smaller. It has a beard and the look of someone who is going to work but I am sure that he is not from world. I decide to go down and talk to him. I descend gently to the sidewalk. I see that he has something on his right  shoulder. It is a little ghost , like Casper, some sort of blue </span><mark class=\" \">flame</mark><span class=\"\"> with a face. I understand that this is his guardian spirit. I say to the man \" Hi! I\\'m on the other side!\" enthusiastically. He nods, with kind eyes and a fair condescending expression. I feel my energy is low so the lucidity will end soon. I say goodbye and promise him to return and have a talk about our worlds. The dream fades.

Finally I </span><mark class=\" \">land</mark><span class=\"\"> in a bathroom. The colors of the walls are very vivid and contrasting (orange, green). The walls have been painted recently. Everything is very bright. I have the feeling that someone else is there but I do not see him. I begin to feel a sense of closure so then decide to change the scenario. I sense there is a person on the other side of a door and then ask her to open that door for me. She does so, but doesn´t want to interact with me. She acts indifferently and leaves. I am now in a very long corridor with extremely vivid orange color. The walls are old bricks as if the area has been abandoned long ago. I floated across the corridor looking for a way out. I feel disgust of being so confined. I always prefer the open spaces in lucid dream trips so I can choose targets of exploration in space. The corridor seems endless but finally it appears a small opening to my left. It is a window. I\\'m not sure if I fit there. I have to enlarge the window or make myself smaller. I decide to melt my body so I could pass through the hole. I do it. I am free. The sky is very dark but the fresh </span><mark class=\" \">air</mark><span class=\"\"> feels great.

My car was parked on a side street behind the old movie theater.  K. and I were going for a drive up a New England coastal town where there had been a recent </span><mark class=\" \">fire</mark><span class=\"\">.  We were looking for the building where the </span><mark class=\" \">fire</mark><span class=\"\"> had been.  She was driving north and I saw it out the window, to the left, as we passed, and I yelled out, “There it was!” but had to laugh because it had already been torn down and we’d already passed it.   We wandered around town and I was admiring a beautiful old tree with yellow bark in front of one of the town buildings (the library?).  Walking under the tree, I noticed small round hard nuts.  “Is this a beechnut?”  I asked.  I’m not sure if I got an answer.  Later, w/ K. and H.  on the lawn in front of a college dorm.  Talking to K., I told her she could give me her address so we could stay in touch, but she didn’t comment and I could tell that it wouldn’t work, but that was ok.  K.  got up to go somewhere (bathroom?), and I decided I needed to go to.   We were there for a performance or event, I think.  Was this a co-ed dorm?  I entered what was a small restaurant in the dorm, with old, ugly, wood-paneled walls.  I looked around for the restroom, but wasn’t sure it was ok to go wandering through the building.  I may have realized I was dreaming because,  at some point, I thought, “What am I thinking?  I can just go to my own bathroom.”  I walked back outside.  We had been planning on camping out on the ground, but no one else was there and I wondered if we should go.  Two guys swooped down, nearly knocking H.over.  Earlier, she was trying to get comfortable on the ground with a pillow.  K. returned and did knock H. over, turning her into a squid, flopping around on the ground.  K. suggested H. might have had a spinal injury the way she was moving about, but it was hard to know or communicate with her in her present form.</span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>hurd2015_pre:water</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>05-26-2018</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>396</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/d2cdebf8-cf51-43ed-a894-f9d00a367836/9d4e3e1a-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Most Recent Dream</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">2.  I am in the garage of a house that morphs between reminding me of my parents’ and Aunt A and Uncle L’s 1st Plantation house – except this one was cluttered not orderly like theirs is/was in WR. Someone is inside the garage with a baby and I am observing them – they aren’t taking very good care of him. There is a diaper changer and other baby items in the garage – like a nursery setup only with typical garage clutter. I think they can’t possibly let the baby sleep in here – they must only change his diaper in here.  It’s dusk out now and I am standing in the driveway. I see rats going in an out of the garage. It’s getting darker outside. I go inside the garage and notice a baby carrier/car seat balanced between a coffee table and couch – it has a thin blanket over it. I think, “No… they wouldn’t leave the baby in it.” I peel back the blanket and see the baby sleeping. I pick him up and he starts to awaken. I am using a soothing voice and rubbing his backside. I feel his bottom and he is soaked – sitting in a </span><mark class=\" \">dirty</mark><span class=\"\"> diaper. I think this is outrageous. I say, “It’s time to take a bath.” I am thinking how he could get bit by rats or get parasites from their droppings by being left in a rat infested  garage. I go inside to bathe him and put on a clean diaper/clothes. I am back in the garage; the baby is older, just learning to walk. He is walking around all this clutter. I yell, “Look out!” A black, wooden shelving unit tipped over and almost crushed him. When I yelled the father turned around and caught the shelf before it could crush the child. I finally speak up, “This is no place for a child to be hanging out. Do you know there are rats in here? I saw rats going in and out of this garage!” He doesn’t seem to care. I think I should call child protective services because this seems like “gross neglect.” They not only keep the child in here, but also leave the garage open and the baby unattended, so anyone could just come in and take the kid.  I observe rats going in and out again. Two rats get killed somehow – I didn’t see how it happened I just heard a strange, non-human, screechy type sound and when I turned around to see what it was I see 2 large rats writhing in the driveway – and then they were silent and still. I wonder how they died or were killed.

Maybe it’s the name of that red-headed woman?</span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>hurd2015_pre:vann</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>05-26-2018</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>217</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/9e623812-211d-478f-a4b0-6d84afc0ecf2/9d4e3353-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Most Recent Dream</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">1. I am at a party. I feel like I don’t quite belong, as everyone else there has some sort of title or ranking; for instance, one of the guests introduces themselves to the person next to me as a baronet and they do not ask for my name because I am nobody really important. The party has come to an end and I have two boxes of my things, mostly books, which I wish to bring as I am moving out of this place. The boxes are heavy and awkward though and I’m not sure how to carry them. A black girl helps me, and her and I carry the boxes outside and through the neighborhood. When she is done I suggest she goes home. She does not know how to get there herself but I see a cop and she heads to him so he can escort her back and make sure she does not get lost. I find a nice looking porch and decide to sit. A man walks up to the porch and looks at me, bemused. He then sits on the porch next to me and stares. I realize that this must be his house and I quickly get up. He still seems a little irritated but also good humored as he strikes up conversation with me. We are sitting in front of a large pit in front of his house, and I sit on the side of it, my legs dangling over. I’m a little worried that I’m going to fall in. He asks if I’ve been to Africa, as he’s been there recently. He says that it has changed quite a lot since the last time he went, which was the last election (when the democratic party had not won). He looks exhausted, with red, cracked eyes, and he says this is because he had crossed a giant bridge and asks me if I’ve ever been on it. I have not been there either but I think I know the one he was talking about – a miles-long green pedestrian bridge going above the </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> outside the city. I jump into the pit, which is about four or five feet below, and we play a game like pool, hitting balls into the holes in the corners. My cousin is there and he and I decide to go somewhere else. We begin walking and all the sudden everything around us looks kind of hazy and I think we’re in a news report about a terrorist attack or a scene of a movie. I look at the building where there should be a panda express but it’s just a picture of a panda, and I say, “See? There isn’t the name ‘Panda Express’ because then that would be copyright infringement, so this must be a movie after all.” We continue walking and I’m really happy to be spending time with him. I’m about to suggest that we should go find somewhere to eat when he spots Y and a female friend by a cart. He rushes over to them and I follow behind, reluctantly. They begin to walk and another group of my cousin’s friends join him. They are all walking quickly now and I have to rush to keep up, as they’re leaving me behind. They stop at a gate and line up, unsure of where it is leading. We get inside and it is a continuation of the park, but with cover above, and we’re told that it’s a preview of some kind of new ‘green’ oxygen experience. The entrance fee is four dollars and we each pay. The woman taking our money asks if I’ve ever been here before, and I say no. She then asks if I’ve used a ‘poop grinder’. I see instructions in a handbook about what that is and look to my right to see a woman squatting inside of a box over a large mechanism which grinds her feces so that it instantly becomes fertilizer. This is absolutely disgusting and I feel a little sick.</span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>hurd2015_pre:vann</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>05-26-2018</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>678</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/46f2d271-9467-4fc9-a3b3-1c4f5ecf913b/9d04990e-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Last Night\\'s Dream 1</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">258.

The first part of the dream is odd. It’s me being with my family around a beach area. They kept wanting to buy an item for the beach and there was a hotel nearby that sold that kind of thing, but also I was friends with a prostitute. Annie wanted to see him and a few other family members, I don’t know. It was strange. I am at a </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\"> with Chad and the van.

The </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\"> was in a wooded area that also had ears that would link a </span><mark class=\" \">pond</mark><span class=\"\">. There were around the banks. big clumps of plant life that man had covered up with tarps, hunting with spears. Chad was doing something in the </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\"> but not hunting. I was on an inflatable bed/chair. At first I started to sink in it. I touched the bottom (like the dream in the </span><mark class=\" \">ocean</mark><span class=\"\">) and pushed back up. After that I began to float, not only on the </span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> but above it and above people but still on the large chair. Some people started to get freaked out. I make it back to the van. A dog like Max is there, Molly (Richard’s dog) and then a gray striped cat that ended up running away on a back road. I was very sad because I wanted to help it. </span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>tanya1:tanya</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>08-30-2017</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>232</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/46f2d271-9467-4fc9-a3b3-1c4f5ecf913b/9d04dd0d-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Last Night\\'s Dream 2</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">453.

I get to one part of the </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\"> that is kinda clogged, with </span><mark class=\" \">sea</mark><span class=\"\"> weed looking like, just </span><mark class=\" \">dirt</mark><span class=\"\"> and debris.

Then I get to a point where I am unsure where to go next and I come to a familiar point in the </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\"> (which has been in my dreams before many times for years, but not recently). I feel very relieved to be here in this familiar place. I am able to let go of the balloon. It took me to a small canoe with a paddle and a bar of soap to put on the bottom to make it more slick. I start to paddle down the </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\">. I pass a few little log cabins and eventually make it to an ending. I am on a familiar </span><mark class=\" \">hill</mark><span class=\"\">, that is also in my dreams. I think to myself, “How can I remember the spot?” because I knew I had seen it before. It would lead me to a park. The transition is unclear but I think either my dad is waiting for me and takes me home or I kinda just end up there. It is wonderful to see my family again. Erica is there as well. We are all playing a game together (reminds me of yesterday’s dream game) almost like we are traveling in each other’s thoughts together. Then Erica stays the night and we sleep in the same bed with a confusion on whether or not to mess around. We wake up in the morning spooning. She is late for work. My brother and I are in the kitchen (of old house in another state). I am looking at him thinking how great it is to see him. We wanted to split an      bowl. I make Erica breakfast before she leaves. [I know there is more to this dream. Okay, so the other thing I remember is being in a building with many other people including friends. They were offering free service. Most everyone close got free tie dye shirts.</span></span></p></div></div><div class=\"sc-qZtVr dLIPjF\"><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAMER ID</div><div>tanya1:tanya</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>DREAM DATE</div><div>08-30-2017</div></div><div class=\"sc-pzLqt jakOsZ\"><div>WORD COUNT</div><div>403</div></div></div></a><a class=\"sc-pciXn kKVZfa\" href=\"/response_sets/46f2d271-9467-4fc9-a3b3-1c4f5ecf913b/9d04c62e-8421-11ea-b97a-0242ac120005\"><div class=\"sc-pjGMk jrwOpx\"><div class=\"sc-psedN fLDHlO\">Dream Text: Last Night\\'s Dream</div><div class=\"sc-qQWDO dxrmGe\"><p class=\"sc-pIvhh gtZHgp\"><span><span class=\"\">386.

We got guitars instead and went to go practice in an empty theater. I got bored with it and went across the street to a new </span><mark class=\" \">diamond</mark><span class=\"\"> museum that was opening up. It was someone famous who owned it. I was wandering and meeting a lot of people. I went back to put up the guitar. I am now in the back seat of a car.

I come back down, this time an older woman is watching me. I run, jump and then fly again. I was twisting and turning. Then I am back in my apartment, which is different. Now there is a man from Halo. I got a scene that he wants to hurt me. So I start running but I am not too afraid because it is a dream. Then I lock him in a closet with a window and white doors. I am yelling for him to disappear. I had little control. Then I start looking for Justin. I find him in a room, he is sleeping on a bed. I wake him up and tell him that this is a dream! “You are in a dream right now.” He did not believe me. Then I tell him that the Halo man is after me. Hazy.

There is some sort of festival or party going on in the streets and alleys. I would keep seeing the same people over again. An extremely intoxicated older man and woman. I kept talking and trying to get away from them at the same time. Also tons of musicians. Being with Jeff’s family and being thankful for their house keeper. Vice versa. Driving Richard’s car with him on a side railway by a science research center. I was very fascinated with my surroundings. I stop to talk with someone and start to slightly drive off the edge. The car falls and so does Richard, down by </span><mark class=\" \">river</mark><span class=\"\">/</span><mark class=\" \">water</mark><span class=\"\"> and a pit of cheetahs/ jag wires.
